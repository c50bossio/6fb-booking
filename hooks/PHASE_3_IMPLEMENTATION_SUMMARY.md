# Phase 3 Security & Compliance Hooks - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented Phase 3 of the BookedBarber V2 Git Hooks system, adding 4 new security and compliance hooks specifically designed for the barber booking platform's unique requirements. These hooks focus on protecting customer data, payment information, and ensuring regulatory compliance for the barbershop business domain.

## Implemented Hooks

### 1. Advanced Secrets Detection Hook (`pre-commit-secrets`)

**Purpose**: Enhanced secrets detection with custom patterns for barber booking platform

**Features**:
- **Stripe API Key Detection**: Comprehensive scanning for test/live keys, webhook secrets
- **Google Services**: API keys, OAuth client secrets, service account private keys
- **Communication Services**: Twilio Account SIDs, SendGrid API keys
- **Database Security**: PostgreSQL/MySQL URLs with credentials, JWT secrets
- **PII Detection**: SSN patterns, credit card numbers, phone/email in logs
- **Environment Validation**: Improper env variable usage, localhost in production
- **Placeholder Detection**: Common placeholder/test credentials

**BookedBarber Specific Patterns**:
- Stripe payment processing keys validation
- Google Calendar integration tokens
- Customer communication API keys (SMS/Email)
- Barbershop appointment data protection
- GDPR-compliant customer data handling

**Security Levels**:
- **Critical**: Live Stripe keys, production database URLs
- **Error**: Test API keys in wrong environment, hardcoded secrets
- **Warning**: Placeholder credentials, minor configuration issues

### 2. GDPR/PCI Compliance Hook (`pre-commit-compliance`)

**Purpose**: Validates data protection compliance for customer and payment data

**Features**:
- **PII Logging Detection**: Prevents customer data in log statements

4. **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions for data access
5. **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for sensitive operations
6. **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data collected and stored

### Compliance Monitoring

1. **GDPR Requirements**:
   - Consent management for data collection
   - Right to access (data export functionality)
   - Right to erasure (complete data deletion)
   - Data portability (structured export formats)
   - Privacy by design (default encryption)

2. **PCI DSS Requirements**:
   - No card data storage (Stripe tokenization)
   - Secure transmission (HTTPS only)
   - Access controls (authentication required)
   - Audit logging (payment transaction trails)
   - Vulnerability management (dependency scanning)

3. **Industry Best Practices**:
   - SOC 2 Type II readiness
   - ISO 27001 alignment
   - NIST Cybersecurity Framework
   - OWASP security guidelines
