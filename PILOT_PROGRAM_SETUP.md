Subject: Invitation: Free Trial - Reduce No-Shows by 25% 

Hi [Customer Name],

I noticed your barbershop has been growing significantly on BookedBarber - congratulations! 

We've just completed development of an appointment reminder system that's shown to reduce no-shows by 15-25% in testing. Since your shop handles [X] appointments per month, this could protect $[X] in revenue monthly.

I'd like to invite you to our exclusive pilot program:

‚úÖ 30-day free trial (normally $39/month)
‚úÖ Personal setup and onboarding call
‚úÖ Custom reminder templates for your brand
‚úÖ Weekly ROI reports showing actual savings
‚úÖ Direct feedback line to our development team

Based on your current appointment volume, our calculator estimates you could protect $[X]/month in revenue while the system costs only $[Y]/month - that's a [Z]x return on investment.

Would you be interested in a 15-minute call this week to discuss how this could benefit your business?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
BookedBarber Team

P.S. We're only accepting 10 shops for this pilot program, and spots are filling up quickly.
```

### **Follow-up Call Script**

```
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from BookedBarber. I sent you an email about our new appointment reminder system pilot program. Do you have a few minutes to chat?

[Listen to their response]

Great! So I looked at your account and saw you're averaging [X] appointments per month. That's fantastic growth! 

One thing I noticed is that no-shows can be a real revenue killer for growing shops like yours. Our new reminder system has been tested with shops similar to yours and we're seeing 15-25% reduction in no-shows.

For a shop your size, that could mean protecting $[X] per month in revenue. The system only costs $39/month, so you'd be looking at roughly a [Y]x return on investment.

Would you be interested in trying it free for 30 days? We're only taking 10 shops for this pilot program, and I'd love to include you if you're interested.

What questions do you have about how it works?"

## üí∞ Conversion Strategy

### **End of Trial Approach**

**Day 25 Check-in:**
```
"Hi [Name], we're coming up on the end of your 30-day trial. Let me share your results:

- You've protected $[X] in revenue over the last 25 days
- Your no-show rate dropped from [X]% to [X]%
- The system has paid for itself [X] times over

Based on these results, continuing with the reminder system would save you approximately $[X] per month while costing only $39.

Would you like to continue with the Professional plan, or do you have questions about the different plan options?"
```

### **Objection Handling**

**"It's too expensive"**
- "I understand cost is a concern. Let's look at the numbers: you're protecting $[X]/month and the cost is only $39. That's a [Y]x return. Can you think of any other investment that gives you that kind of return?"

**"I need to think about it"**
- "I completely understand. What specific concerns do you have? Maybe I can address them. Also, would it help if I extended your trial another week while you decide?"

**"I'm not sure it's working"**
- "Let me pull up your exact numbers... [show data]. Your no-show rate dropped from [X]% to [X]%. That's $[X] in protected revenue. What would need to change for you to feel confident it's working?"
