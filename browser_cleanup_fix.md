# Browser Cleanup Instructions - Fix Login Redirect Loop

## Quick Fix - Run This in Browser Console

Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12 or right-click â†’ Inspect), go to the Console tab, and paste this code:

```javascript
// Clear all authentication data
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
document.cookie.split(";").forEach(function(c) { 
    document.cookie = c.replace(/^ +/, "").replace(/=.*/, "=;expires=" + new Date().toUTCString() + ";path=/");
});
console.log("âœ… All authentication data cleared!");
console.log("ðŸ”„ Reloading page...");
location.reload();
```

## Alternative Method - Manual Clear

If you prefer to clear manually:

1. **Chrome/Edge:**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)
   - Select "Cookies and other site data"
   - Select "Cached images and files"
   - Click "Clear data"

2. **Firefox:**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)
   - Select "Cookies" and "Cache"
   - Click "Clear"

3. **Safari:**
   - Safari menu â†’ Preferences â†’ Privacy
   - Click "Manage Website Data"
   - Search for "localhost"
   - Click "Remove"

## After Clearing

1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. Login with your credentials:
   - **Email**: `admin@bookedbarber.com`
   - **Password**: `admin123`

You should now be successfully redirected to the dashboard with full enterprise access!

## What Was Fixed

The authentication endpoint (`/auth/me`) was returning incomplete data, missing critical fields like:
- `onboarding_completed`
- `is_new_user`
- `onboarding_status`

These missing fields caused the dashboard to think you were a new user and redirect you back to login. The fix ensures all required fields are properly returned.
