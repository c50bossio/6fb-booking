# Render Deployment Fix - Immediate Actions

## Issue Found
The Render deployment is not automatically updating because `autoDeploy` is set to `false` in the render.yaml configuration.

## Current Status
- ✅ All commits are pushed to GitHub (verified with `git log origin/main..HEAD`)
- ✅ Build scripts are executable (render-build.sh has correct permissions)
- ✅ Main.py has the deployment trigger timestamp (line 3: "Force deployment trigger - Updated: 2025-06-23 14:30:00 UTC")
- ✅ Git remote is correctly configured (https://github.com/c50bossio/6fb-booking.git)
- ✅ On the correct branch (main)
- ✅ Health endpoint includes version tracking via RELEASE_VERSION env var
- ❌ **autoDeploy is disabled in render.yaml (line 78 for backend, line 114 for frontend)**

## Immediate Fixes

### Option 1: Enable Auto-Deploy (Recommended)
1. Update render.yaml to enable auto-deploy:
```yaml
# Change line 78 and 114 from:
autoDeploy: false  # Enable after initial setup
# To:
autoDeploy: true
```

2. Commit and push:
```bash
git add render.yaml
git commit -m "Enable auto-deploy for Render services"
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Manual Deploy via Render Dashboard
1. Log into Render Dashboard (https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Navigate to your service: `6fb-booking-backend`
3. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
4. Monitor the deploy logs for any issues

### Option 3: Deploy via Render CLI
```bash
# Install Render CLI if not already installed
brew tap render-oss/render
brew install render

# Deploy manually
render deploy --service-id <your-service-id>
```

### Option 4: Webhook Trigger
If you have a deploy hook URL from Render:
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.render.com/deploy/<your-deploy-hook-id>
```

## Additional Checks
1. Verify in Render Dashboard:
   - Service is connected to the correct GitHub repo
   - Branch filter is set to "main" (not another branch)
   - Environment variables are all set correctly

2. Check deploy logs in Render Dashboard for any build failures

3. Verify the service URL is responding:
   ```bash
   curl https://sixfb-backend.onrender.com/health
   ```

## Monitoring After Fix
After enabling auto-deploy or triggering manual deploy:
1. Watch the deploy logs in Render Dashboard
2. Check the deployed version endpoint: https://sixfb-backend.onrender.com/version
3. Verify the timestamp matches your latest commit
4. Test a few API endpoints to ensure functionality

## Long-term Solution
Consider setting up:
- Render deploy notifications via webhook
- GitHub Actions for deployment status checks
- Monitoring alerts for failed deploys
