Plan: starter ($7/month)
Version: PostgreSQL 15
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables (10 minutes)
**Backend Service Dashboard**: Set these critical variables:
```bash
SECRET_KEY=[Use Render's "Generate Value"]
JWT_SECRET_KEY=[Use Render's "Generate Value"] 
ENCRYPTION_KEY=[Use Render's "Generate Value"]
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_[YOUR_TEST_KEY]
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_[YOUR_TEST_KEY]
```

**Frontend Service Dashboard**: Set:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_[YOUR_TEST_KEY]
```

### 3. Optional: External Services (5-15 minutes each)
- **SendGrid**: For email testing (optional)
- **Google OAuth**: For calendar integration testing (optional)
- **Sentry**: For error tracking (optional)
