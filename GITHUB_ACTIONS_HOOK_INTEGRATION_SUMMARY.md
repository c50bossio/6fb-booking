## üîß Technical Implementation

### Hook-CI Mapping Strategy

| Phase | Local Hook Purpose | CI Enhancement | Optimization |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Phase 1** | Fast validation | Comprehensive analysis | Cache & skip logic |
| **Phase 2** | Basic quality checks | Full quality suite | Enhanced tools |
| **Phase 3** | Security validation | Production-grade security | Multi-tool scanning |

```

### Optimization Logic Flow

```
1. Check if hook passed locally recently (5min cache)
2. Analyze file changes for relevance
3. Skip CI check if optimization conditions met
4. Otherwise run enhanced CI validation
5. Cache results for future optimization
6. Generate performance reports
```
