## Setup Process

### Step 1: Enable Square Payouts

1. Log into [Square Dashboard](https://squareup.com/dashboard)
2. Go to **Team** â†’ **Team Management**
3. Enable **Team Member Payouts** feature
4. This allows you to pay team members directly

### Step 2: Add Barbers as Team Members

For each barber:

```bash
POST /api/v1/barber-payments/setup-square-team-member
{
  "barber_id": 1,
  "location_id": "YOUR_SQUARE_LOCATION_ID"
}
```

This will:
- Create a Square team member account
- Send them an invitation email
- They'll set up their bank account with Square

### Step 3: Barber Accepts Invitation

Barbers will:
1. Receive email from Square
2. Click "Accept Invitation"
3. Create Square account (or log in)
4. Add their bank account details
5. Verify with micro-deposits (optional)

### Step 4: Process Payouts

Once barbers are set up, process weekly payouts:

```bash
# Individual payout
POST /api/v1/barber-payments/payouts/process
{
  "barber_id": 1,
  "period_start": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "period_end": "2024-01-07T23:59:59Z",
  "instant_payout": false  # true for instant (1.75% fee)
}

# Batch payouts for all barbers
POST /api/v1/barber-payments/payouts/batch?location_id=LOC_ID&period_start=2024-01-01&period_end=2024-01-07
```

## Commission Structure
