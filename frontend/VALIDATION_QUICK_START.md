# Frontend Validation & Monitoring Quick Start

This guide helps you quickly get started with the frontend validation and monitoring tools.

## 🚀 Quick Deployment Checklist

Run these commands in order before deploying:

```bash
# 1. Validate your frontend is ready
npm run validate:deployment

# 2. Create a rollback checkpoint
npm run rollback:checkpoint

# 3. Deploy to your platform
# (Platform-specific command)

# 4. Verify deployment health
npm run health:check https://your-deployed-url.com

# 5. Run performance baseline
npm run performance:baseline https://your-deployed-url.com
```

## 📊 Monitoring Your Deployment

### Option 1: Quick Health Check
```bash
npm run health:check https://your-app.onrender.com
```

### Option 2: Continuous Monitoring
```bash
npm run health:monitor https://your-app.onrender.com
```

## 🔄 If Something Goes Wrong

1. **Don't Panic!** You have a rollback plan.

2. **Execute Rollback:**
   ```bash
   npm run rollback:execute
   ```

3. **Follow the Interactive Prompts**
   - Choose your platform (Render/Vercel)
   - Select rollback method
   - Verify the rollback worked

## 📋 Understanding Validation Output

### ✅ Green = Good
Everything passed, safe to deploy

### ⚠️ Yellow = Warning
Non-critical issues, can deploy but should fix soon

### ❌ Red = Error
Must fix before deploying

## 📈 Performance Targets

Your app should meet these targets:

| Metric | Target | What it means |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| First Paint | < 1.8s | When user sees something |
| Interactive | < 3.8s | When user can interact |
| Bundle Size | < 300KB | Initial JavaScript size |

## 🛠️ Common Fixes

### "Node version too old"
```bash
# Install Node 18+
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```

### "Dependencies out of date"
```bash
npm update
npm audit fix
```

### "Build failed"
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
rm -rf .next node_modules
npm ci
npm run build
```

### "Environment variables missing"
Create `.env.local` with required variables:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-api.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app.com
```
