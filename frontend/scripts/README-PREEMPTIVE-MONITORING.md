    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Start full preemptive monitoring
npm run monitor:preemptive

# Run with verbose output
npm run monitor:verbose

# Show help
node scripts/preemptive-issue-detector.js --help
```

### Monitoring Modes

1. **Full Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring with all features enabled
2. **Prediction Mode**: Run analysis and generate predictions without continuous monitoring
3. **Analysis Mode**: Analyze historical data and generate reports

### Integration with Existing Monitoring

The preemptive detector works alongside your existing monitoring systems:

```bash
# Start development with preemptive monitoring
npm run dev:with-monitoring & npm run monitor:preemptive

# Dashboard mode with both systems
npm run dev:dashboard & npm run monitor:verbose
```

## How It Works

### Predictive Models

The system maintains several predictive models:

#### Memory Model
- **Trend Analysis**: Linear regression on recent memory usage
- **Leak Detection**: Identifies consistent upward trends
- **Prediction Horizon**: 5 minutes ahead for critical alerts
- **Auto-Remediation**: Cache clearing and garbage collection

#### CPU Model
- **Load Monitoring**: Tracks CPU usage and load averages
- **Overload Prediction**: Forecasts when CPU will exceed thresholds
- **Process Analysis**: Identifies resource-heavy processes

#### Disk Model
- **Space Tracking**: Monitors disk usage over time
- **Growth Prediction**: Forecasts when disk will be full
- **Cleanup Automation**: Removes old logs and build artifacts

#### Network Model
- **Latency Patterns**: Tracks response times and connectivity
- **Degradation Detection**: Identifies network performance issues
- **Connectivity Monitoring**: Ensures stable network access

### Risk Assessment

The system calculates overall risk using weighted factors:

```javascript
Risk Factors:
- Memory: 25% weight
- CPU: 20% weight
- Disk: 15% weight
- Network: 10% weight
- Build Performance: 15% weight
- Log Analysis: 10% weight
- Dependencies: 5% weight
```

### Alert System

#### Alert Levels
1. **Info**: General information and trends
2. **Warning**: Potential issues requiring attention
3. **Critical**: Issues requiring immediate action
4. **Emergency**: System failure imminent

#### Smart Suppression
- Prevents alert spam by suppressing similar alerts within 5 minutes
- Escalation system for repeated issues
- Contextual recommendations for each alert type

## Data Storage

### Directory Structure
```
logs/preemptive-data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ metrics/          # Raw metric data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ predictions/      # Prediction results
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/           # Trained models and baselines
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/             # System logs

lsof -i :3000

# Terminate non-development processes
kill [PID]
```

```

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Development Server Integration
The preemptive detector runs alongside your development server:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start development server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start preemptive monitoring
npm run monitor:preemptive
```

### Build Process Integration
Monitor build performance during CI/CD:

```bash
# Before build
npm run monitor:predict

# During build (background monitoring)
npm run monitor:preemptive &
npm run build

# After build (analysis)
npm run monitor:analyze
```

### Deployment Integration
Pre-deployment health checks:

```bash
# Pre-deployment validation
npm run monitor:predict
npm run validate:deployment

# Post-deployment monitoring
npm run monitor:preemptive --production
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### High Memory Usage Alerts
```bash
# Check current memory usage
top -o mem

# Clear development caches
npm run clean
npm run clear-cache

# Restart development server
npm run dev:fresh
```

#### Build Performance Degradation
```bash
# Clear all caches
npm run clean
rm -rf node_modules/.cache

# Reinstall dependencies
npm ci

# Update build tools
npm update next webpack
```

#### Port Conflicts
```bash
# Check port usage
lsof -i :3000

# Kill conflicting processes
npm run kill-port

# Use alternative port
PORT=3001 npm run dev
```

### Debugging

Enable verbose logging for detailed information:

```bash
# Verbose monitoring
npm run monitor:verbose

# Debug mode with detailed analysis
node scripts/preemptive-issue-detector.js --verbose
```

### Log Analysis

Check system logs for detailed information:

```bash
# View recent alerts
cat logs/preemptive-data/logs/preemptive-*.log

# View predictions
ls logs/preemptive-data/predictions/

# View current models
cat logs/preemptive-data/models/current-models.json
```

## Performance Impact

### Resource Usage
- **CPU**: Minimal impact (<2% CPU usage)
- **Memory**: ~50MB additional memory usage
- **Disk**: Log files and data storage (~100MB max)
