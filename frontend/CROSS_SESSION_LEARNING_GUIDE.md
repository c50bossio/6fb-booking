- Adapts thresholds and settings to your environment
- Improves recommendations as more data is collected

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Get personalized recommendations
npm run learn:recommend

# Analyze your development patterns
npm run learn:analyze

# Use smart development mode (automatically chooses best method)
npm run dev:smart

# Optimize your preferences based on learning data
npm run learn:optimize
```

### Manual Learning

```bash
# Record a successful session
npm run learn:success --data='{"startup_method":"dev:safe","duration":4.2}'

# Record a failed session
npm run learn:failure --data='{"startup_method":"dev:raw","error_type":"port_conflict"}'
```

## Data Storage

The system stores learning data in JSON files under `learning-data/`:

- **`learning-data.json`**: Complete session history and learned patterns
- **`user-preferences.json`**: Personal preferences and optimized settings
- **`success-patterns.json`**: Identified success patterns and correlations
- **`environmental-factors.json`**: Environmental correlation data

## Integration with Development Scripts

### Smart Development Mode

The system provides a smart development mode that automatically selects the best startup method based on your learning data:

```bash
npm run dev:smart
```

This command:
1. Analyzes your historical patterns
2. Shows pre-start recommendations
3. Automatically executes the most successful method for your environment
4. Records the session outcome for future learning

### Automatic Learning Integration

Use the learning wrapper to automatically track any development command:

```bash
# Auto-detect method and track outcome
npm run dev:learning npm run dev:safe

# Manual method specification
node scripts/learning-integration-wrapper.js --method=dev:fresh --command="npm run dev:fresh"
```

## Understanding the Recommendations

### Confidence Levels

The system builds confidence over time:
- **0-30%**: Learning phase, generic recommendations
- **30-70%**: Moderate confidence, personalized suggestions
- **70%+**: High confidence, strong recommendations

### Recommendation Types

1. **Startup Method Recommendations**
   - Based on success rates for different methods
   - Considers environmental context
   - Example: *"Based on your history, 'dev:safe' works best during morning hours"*

2. **Environmental Warnings**
   - Memory usage patterns
   - Port conflict predictions
   - Time-based performance insights
   - Example: *"Your system performs better with validation skipped when memory usage > 85%"*

3. **Proactive Suggestions**
   - Cache cleanup recommendations
   - Port management advice
   - Optimization opportunities
   - Example: *"Consider clearing cache - last 3 failures resolved with cache cleanup"*

```

## Technical Details

### Environmental Data Collected

- **System Metrics**: Memory usage, disk space, CPU load
- **Network Conditions**: Connectivity status, latency measurements
- **Process Information**: Running process count, port usage
- **Temporal Context**: Hour, day of week, time of day categorization

### Error Categorization

The system intelligently categorizes errors into types:
- `port_conflict`: Port already in use issues
- `dependency_issue`: Missing modules or npm issues
- `network_issue`: Connectivity problems
- `memory_issue`: Out of memory conditions
- `cache_issue`: Cache corruption problems
- `validation_failure`: Linting or validation errors

```bash
# Backup current data
cp -r learning-data learning-data-backup

# Reset learning system
rm -rf learning-data

# Start fresh (the system will recreate default files)
npm run learn:recommend
```

### Low Confidence Recommendations

If confidence remains low after many sessions:
- Ensure you're using consistent startup methods
- Check for environmental factors causing inconsistency
- Review the analysis to identify patterns
- Consider if your development environment is too variable

Create a personalized startup script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# smart-dev.sh
echo "🧠 Checking learning recommendations..."
npm run learn:recommend --silent

echo "🚀 Starting with optimal method..."
npm run dev:smart
```

### CI/CD Integration

Track deployment success patterns:

```bash
# In your deployment script
if deployment_success; then
    node scripts/cross-session-learning.js --learn success --data='{"method":"deployment","environment":"production"}'
else
    node scripts/cross-session-learning.js --learn failure --data='{"method":"deployment","error_type":"deployment_failure"}'
