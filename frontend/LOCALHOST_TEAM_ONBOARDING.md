## üåü System Overview

### Why We Built This
Before this system, developers lost hours debugging localhost connectivity issues caused by:
- Port conflicts
- Browser extensions
- DNS cache problems
- Build cache corruption
- Network configuration issues

### What It Does
Our prevention system:
- **Prevents** issues before they happen
- **Detects** problems automatically
- **Diagnoses** root causes quickly
- **Fixes** issues with one command
- **Monitors** health continuously

### Core Philosophy
1. **Prevention First** - Catch issues before they impact you
2. **Progressive Solutions** - Start simple, escalate if needed
3. **One Command** - Most problems solved with a single command
4. **Team Consistency** - Everyone uses the same tools and workflows

## üöÄ Day 1: Initial Setup

### Prerequisites Checklist
- [ ] Node.js 18+ installed (`node --version`)
- [ ] npm 8+ installed (`npm --version`)
- [ ] Git configured
- [ ] Access to 6FB repository
- [ ] Chrome or Firefox installed

### Step 1: Clone and Install
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd 6fb-booking/frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Step 2: Initial Validation
```bash
# Run comprehensive validation
npm run dev:validate:full

# If any issues are found, fix them
npm run fix-localhost -- --full
```

### Step 3: Configure Your Browser
```bash
# Run interactive browser configuration
./scripts/configure-development-browser.sh

# This will:
# - Create a development browser profile
# - Configure extension settings
# - Generate launch scripts
```

### Step 4: First Development Start
```bash
# Use the orchestrated startup (recommended)
npm run dev:orchestrated

# This will:
# 1. Validate your environment
# 2. Fix any issues found
# 3. Start health monitoring
# 4. Launch the development server
```

### Step 5: Verify Everything Works
1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Check for the Extension Detector popup (if you have extensions)
3. Verify you can see the application
4. Check console for any errors

### End of Day 1 Checklist
- [ ] Development environment running
- [ ] Browser configured for development
- [ ] Can access localhost:3000
- [ ] Understand basic `npm run dev:orchestrated` command

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 2: Understanding the Tools

### Morning: The Master Troubleshooter
Our primary tool for fixing issues:

```bash
# Three severity levels
npm run fix-localhost              # Quick (30-60s)
npm run fix-localhost -- --full    # Full (2-5min)
npm run fix-localhost -- --nuclear # Nuclear (5-10min)

# Safe preview mode
npm run fix-localhost -- --dry-run
```

**Exercise 1**: Run each mode in dry-run to see what they do

### Afternoon: Development Startup Modes
Different ways to start development:

```bash
# Four startup modes
npm run dev:orchestrated   # Recommended: Full protection
npm run dev:express       # Fast: Minimal checks
npm run dev:safe         # Balanced: Standard checks
npm run dev:bulletproof  # Paranoid: Maximum protection
```

**Exercise 2**: Try each startup mode and note the differences

### Understanding Health Monitoring
```bash
# Start monitoring in background
npm run dev:monitor

# View monitoring dashboard
npm run dev:dashboard

# Check logs
tail -f logs/dev-health-*.log
```

**Exercise 3**: Start monitoring and trigger some issues to see alerts

### Extension Detection
```bash
# Run extension compatibility check
npm run debug:extensions

# In browser console
window.runExtensionDetection()
```

**Exercise 4**: Identify any problematic extensions you have

### End of Day 2 Checklist
- [ ] Understand troubleshooter severity levels
- [ ] Know different startup modes
- [ ] Can run health monitoring
- [ ] Checked browser extensions

---

## üéÆ Day 3: Practice Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Port Conflict
**Setup**: Start another process on port 3000
```bash
# In another terminal
npx http-server -p 3000
```

**Fix**:
```bash
npm run kill-port
# or
npm run fix-localhost
```

### Scenario 2: Extension Blocking
**Setup**: Enable an ad blocker without localhost whitelist

**Fix**:
```bash
# Detect the issue
npm run debug:extensions

# Test in incognito
# Configure the extension for localhost
```

### Scenario 3: Cache Corruption
**Setup**: Manually corrupt .next directory

**Fix**:
```bash
npm run clean
# or
npm run fix-localhost -- --full
```

### Scenario 4: Complete Failure
**Setup**: Delete node_modules

**Fix**:
```bash
npm run emergency:fix
# or
npm run fix-localhost -- --nuclear
```

### End of Day 3 Checklist
- [ ] Successfully resolved port conflict
- [ ] Fixed extension blocking issue
- [ ] Cleared corrupted cache
- [ ] Recovered from major failure

## üìÖ Week 1: Daily Workflows

### Monday: Standard Development
```bash
# Morning startup
npm run dev:orchestrated

# If issues during the day
npm run fix-localhost

# End of day
# Commit your work
# No special shutdown needed
```

### Tuesday: Working with Backend
```bash
# Start backend first
cd ../backend && uvicorn main:app --reload

# Then frontend with validation
cd ../frontend && npm run dev:orchestrated

# Monitor both
npm run dev:monitor
```

### Wednesday: Heavy Development Day

# Use bulletproof mode for important work
npm run dev:bulletproof

# Keep dashboard open
npm run dev:dashboard

# Quick health check
curl -I http://localhost:3000
curl -I http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/health
```

### Thursday: Testing and Debugging
```bash
# Fresh start for testing
npm run dev:fresh

# If testing payments/auth
# Use incognito mode to avoid extension issues

# Debug specific issues
