## API Endpoints Used

1. **GET** `/api/v1/appointments` - Fetch appointments with filters
2. **POST** `/api/v1/appointments` - Create new appointment
3. **PUT** `/api/v1/appointments/{id}` - Update appointment
4. **DELETE** `/api/v1/appointments/{id}` - Cancel appointment  
5. **POST** `/api/v1/appointments/{id}/reschedule` - Reschedule via drag & drop
6. **GET** `/api/v1/barbers` - Fetch active barbers
7. **GET** `/api/v1/services` - Fetch available services

## Testing the Calendar

1. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Start the frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Login to get access token**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/login
   - Use your test credentials

4. **Navigate to Calendar**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/dashboard/calendar
   - The calendar will automatically load appointments for the current week

5. **Test Features:**
   - Click empty slots to create appointments
   - Click appointments to view/edit details
   - Drag appointments to reschedule
   - Use week/day view toggle
   - Filter by barbers
   - Export data to CSV

## Troubleshooting

If appointments don't load:
1. Check backend is running
2. Verify you're logged in (check for auth token)
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure database has test data

To test the API integration:
```bash
node test-calendar-api.js
```

## Next Steps

The calendar is now fully functional! Some optional enhancements could include:
- Google Calendar sync
- Email notifications for appointments
- Recurring appointments
- Client appointment history in details modal
- Print-friendly calendar view
- Advanced filtering (by service, status, etc.)

The calendar now provides a complete appointment management system integrated with your backend!
