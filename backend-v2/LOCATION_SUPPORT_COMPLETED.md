# Location/Multi-Shop Support Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Implementation Completed

### 1. **Location Schemas Added** (`schemas.py`)
- `LocationResponse` - Response model for location data
- `LocationListResponse` - List of locations with metadata
- `LocationCreate` - Schema for creating new locations
- `LocationUpdate` - Schema for updating locations

### 2. **Locations Router Refactored** (`routers/locations.py`)
- Completely rewritten to use Organization model as locations
- Full CRUD operations for locations
- Location-aware access control
- Location statistics endpoint
- Multi-location enterprise support

### 3. **Database Models Updated**
- **Appointment Model**: Changed `location_id` to `organization_id`
- **Payment Model**: Changed `location_id` to `organization_id`
- Added relationships to Organization model
- Created migrations for both tables

### 4. **Migrations Created**
- `add_organization_id_to_appointments.py` - Migrates appointments to use organization_id
- `add_organization_id_to_payments.py` - Migrates payments to use organization_id

### 5. **Cache Invalidation**
- Location changes invalidate organization cache
- Already integrated with existing cache invalidation service

## üè¢ How Multi-Location Works

### Organization Hierarchy
```
Enterprise (Headquarters)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Location 1 (Barbershop A)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Location 2 (Barbershop B)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Location 3 (Barbershop C)
```

### Location Types
- **INDEPENDENT**: Single location barbershop
- **HEADQUARTERS**: Main organization for multi-location
- **LOCATION**: Individual location within enterprise
- **FRANCHISE**: Franchised location

### User Access
- **Enterprise Owner**: Access to all locations
- **Location Manager**: Access to specific location(s)
- **Barber**: Works at one or more locations
- **Admin**: System-wide access

## üìç API Endpoints

### Location Management
- `GET /locations/` - List accessible locations
- `GET /locations/{id}` - Get specific location
- `POST /locations/` - Create new location
- `PUT /locations/{id}` - Update location
- `DELETE /locations/{id}` - Delete/deactivate location
- `GET /locations/{id}/stats` - Location statistics

### Location-Aware Booking
Appointments now include `organization_id` to track which location the service is at.

## üîÑ Migration Instructions

1. **Run Database Migrations**:
```bash
cd backend-v2
alembic upgrade head
```

2. **Update Existing Data**:
- Single location users continue working as-is
- Multi-location users can create child organizations

3. **Frontend Updates Needed**:
- Add location selector to booking flow
- Add location switcher to dashboard
- Filter data by selected location

## üéØ Benefits

1. **Scalability**: Support unlimited locations per enterprise
2. **Flexibility**: Each location can have its own settings
3. **Analytics**: Compare performance across locations
4. **Billing**: Each location can have separate billing
5. **Access Control**: Granular permissions per location

## üìä Usage Examples

### Creating a Multi-Location Setup
1. Create headquarters organization
2. Create child locations with `parent_organization_id`
3. Assign staff to specific locations
4. Configure location-specific settings

### Booking at a Location
```python
# When creating appointment
appointment_data = {
    "service_id": 1,
    "barber_id": 2,
    "organization_id": 3,  # The location ID
    "start_time": "2025-01-10 14:00:00"
}
```

### Analytics by Location
```python
# Get stats for specific location
GET /locations/3/stats

# Filter appointments by location
GET /appointments?organization_id=3
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Backwards Compatibility**: Existing single-location setups continue to work
2. **Organization = Location**: We use the Organization model to represent locations
3. **No Separate Location Model**: This reduces complexity and duplication
4. **Gradual Migration**: Users can upgrade to multi-location when needed

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Frontend Integration**: Update UI to support location selection
2. **Barber Scheduling**: Allow barbers to work at multiple locations
3. **Location-Based Pricing**: Different prices per location
4. **Location-Specific Services**: Services available only at certain locations
5. **Inter-Location Transfers**: Move appointments between locations
