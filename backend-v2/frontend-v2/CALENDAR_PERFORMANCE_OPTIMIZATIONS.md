# Calendar Performance Optimizations

## Summary of Performance Enhancements Added to CalendarDayView

### 1. **Preloading Adjacent Days**
- Added `onPreloadDate` prop to enable preloading of next/previous day data
- Automatically preloads adjacent days when viewing current day
- Maintains a cache of up to 7 days to balance memory usage and performance
- Preloading is delayed by 100ms to avoid blocking the main thread

### 2. **Debounced Navigation**
- Implemented 150ms debounce for navigation clicks (previous/next/today)
- Prevents rapid navigation requests that could overwhelm the API
- Ensures smooth animations by preventing interruptions

### 3. **Memoized Calculations**
- `getAppointmentStyle`: Memoized with dependencies on `startHour` and `slotDuration`
- `getStatusColor`: Memoized with no dependencies (pure function)
- `isCurrentTimeSlot`: Memoized with dependencies on `currentDay` and `slotDuration`
- `isSlotBooked`: Memoized with dependency on `filteredAppointments`
- `getServiceBadgeClass`: Memoized with no dependencies (pure function)

### 4. **Optimized Re-renders**
- Added custom comparison function to React.memo
- Only re-renders when critical props change:
  - appointments
  - selectedBarberId
  - currentDate
  - barbers
  - clients
  - startHour/endHour
  - slotDuration
- Prevents unnecessary re-renders from callback prop changes

### 5. **Separated Current Time Indicator**
- Extracted current time indicator into a separate memoized component
- Updates independently every minute without re-rendering the entire calendar
- Reduces main component re-renders by 60x for time updates

### 6. **Resource Cleanup**
- Added cleanup effect to clear navigation debounce timer on unmount
- Prevents memory leaks from pending timers

## Usage Example

```typescript
// In parent component
const handlePreloadDate = useCallback(async (date: Date) => {
  // Fetch appointments for the given date in the background
  // This will be called automatically for adjacent days
  await fetchAppointmentsForDate(date)
}, [])

<CalendarDayView
  appointments={appointments}
  onPreloadDate={handlePreloadDate}
  // ... other props
/>
```

## Performance Impact

These optimizations provide:
- **Faster navigation**: Adjacent days load instantly from cache
- **Smoother interactions**: Debouncing prevents UI jank from rapid clicks
- **Reduced CPU usage**: Memoized calculations prevent redundant work
- **Lower memory footprint**: Efficient re-render prevention
- **Better responsiveness**: Time indicator updates don't block interactions

## Future Optimization Opportunities

1. Virtual scrolling for very long time ranges
2. Web Worker for complex appointment calculations
3. IndexedDB caching for offline support
4. Progressive loading for large appointment datasets
