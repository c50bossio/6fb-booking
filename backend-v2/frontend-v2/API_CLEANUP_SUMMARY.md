## Analysis of Duplication Patterns

### Pattern 1: Version Evolution
The later versions (higher line numbers) generally contained:
- Better TypeScript typing with specific interfaces
- More modern parameter handling (using filter objects vs. individual parameters)
- Improved error handling
- Cleaner code structure

### Pattern 2: API Endpoint Consistency
- First versions often used inconsistent endpoint patterns
- Later versions followed more standardized REST API patterns
- Better parameter validation in newer versions

### Pattern 3: Return Type Improvements
- Earlier versions often returned `any` or generic types
- Later versions had specific TypeScript interfaces
- Better Promise typing in newer implementations

## Recommended Consolidation Strategy

### Functions to Keep (Later Versions)
Based on analysis, the **second occurrence** of each duplicate function should be retained because:

1. **Better Type Safety**: Later versions use specific TypeScript interfaces
2. **Modern Parameter Handling**: Use of filter objects vs. individual parameters
3. **Consistent API Patterns**: Follow established REST conventions
4. **Improved Error Handling**: Better error message handling and validation

### Functions to Remove (Earlier Versions)
The first occurrence of each duplicate function should be removed because:

1. **Legacy Parameter Patterns**: Use outdated parameter structures
2. **Weak Typing**: Often use `any` types or missing return type annotations
3. **Inconsistent Endpoints**: Don't follow standardized API patterns
4. **Limited Error Handling**: Basic or missing error handling

## File Structure Impact

### Original File Stats
- **Total Lines**: 4,459
- **Total Functions**: 207 exported functions
- **Duplicate Functions**: 31 (appearing twice each)
- **Estimated Cleanup**: Remove ~1,200-1,500 lines of duplicate code

### Expected Consolidated File Stats
- **Estimated Lines**: ~3,000-3,200 (reduction of ~1,200 lines)
- **Total Functions**: 176 unique exported functions
- **Duplicate Functions**: 0

## Implementation Challenges Encountered

### Complex Nested Structure
- Functions contain complex nested braces making regex-based removal difficult
- Mixed with TypeScript interfaces and type definitions
- Some functions span 20+ lines with complex parameter handling

### Interdependencies
- Some duplicated functions reference different TypeScript interfaces
- Interface definitions also duplicated in some cases
- Import statements may need adjustment after cleanup

### Syntax Preservation
- Need to maintain proper TypeScript syntax
- Preserve existing import statements and interfaces
- Ensure no orphaned code blocks remain

## Manual Cleanup Approach Recommended

Given the complexity and interdependencies, a **manual cleanup approach** is recommended:

1. **Start with Payment Functions**: These have clear differences and fewer dependencies
2. **Remove Service Management Duplicates**: Second largest group of duplicates
3. **Clean Notification Functions**: These are well-isolated
4. **Handle Export Functions**: These are at file boundaries making them easier to remove
5. **Test After Each Section**: Ensure TypeScript compilation after each group

## Benefits of Cleanup

### Code Maintainability
- Eliminate confusion about which function to use
- Reduce cognitive load for developers
- Ensure consistent API usage patterns

### Build Performance
- Smaller bundle size
- Faster TypeScript compilation
- Reduced memory usage during development

### Type Safety
- Remove conflicting type definitions
- Ensure consistent return types
- Better IDE autocomplete and error detection

## Status
- **Analysis**: ✅ Complete
- **Backup Created**: ✅ lib/api.ts.backup
- **Partial Cleanup**: ⚠️ In Progress (3 major duplicates removed manually)
- **Full Cleanup**: ⏳ Pending (requires systematic manual approach)
- **Testing**: ⏳ Pending cleanup completion

## Recommendations

1. **Implement Duplication Prevention**: Add pre-commit hooks to detect function duplicates
2. **Code Review Process**: Ensure new functions don't duplicate existing ones
3. **API Documentation**: Document the consolidated API to prevent future duplications
4. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Enable stricter TypeScript settings to catch duplications earlier
