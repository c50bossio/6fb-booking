3. Manual testing of login flow
4. Basic barber dashboard implementation

### Short Term (Next Week)
1. Implement calendar management features
2. Add client management system
3. Create earnings dashboard
4. Mobile optimization improvements

### Medium Term (Next Month)
1. Comprehensive barber feature suite
2. Advanced analytics and reporting
3. Mobile app considerations
4. Performance optimization

## Conclusion

The Barber User testing revealed a **critical authentication bottleneck** that prevents access to core barbershop management features. While the basic infrastructure (mobile responsiveness, UI framework) is solid, the barber-specific functionality is essentially **non-functional** due to authentication failures.

**Priority focus should be on fixing the authentication system** to unlock testing of the complete barber user experience. Once authentication is resolved, comprehensive testing of calendar, client management, and financial features can be completed.

The **50% success rate** primarily reflects the limited scope of testable features rather than systemic issues with the implemented functionality.
