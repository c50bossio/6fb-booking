- `/api/v1/payments/gift-certificates/export` - Data export

## 2. Data Flow Integrity Analysis

### 2.1 TypeScript Interface Coverage

**Frontend Type Definitions Found:**
- Core API types in `/types/api.ts`
- Integration types in `/types/integration.ts`
- Booking types in `/types/booking-links.ts`
- Calendar types in `/types/calendar.ts`
- Review types in `/types/review.ts`
- Tracking types in `/types/tracking.ts`
- Product types in `/types/product.ts`

**Backend Schema Coverage:**
- Comprehensive Pydantic models in `schemas.py`
- Additional schemas in `schemas_new/` directory
- Specialized schemas for different modules

### 2.2 Data Model Consistency Issues

**Potential Mismatches Identified:**
1. **Appointment Model:** Frontend expects `appointment_date` parameter while backend uses `date`
2. **Booking Response:** Frontend normalizes appointment data with calculated `end_time`
3. **User Profile:** Frontend calls `/api/v1/users/profile` but backend has `/api/v1/auth/me`
4. **Service Categories:** Frontend expects `/api/v1/services/categories` structure

### 2.3 Request/Response Validation

The frontend implements comprehensive validation:
- **Request Validation:** `validateAPIRequest()` function in `apiUtils.ts`
- **Response Validation:** `validateAPIResponse()` function
- **Error Handling:** Structured error handling with retry mechanisms
- **Performance Monitoring:** API call performance tracking

## 3. Authentication Integration Analysis

### 3.1 Authentication Flow Status: ✅ GOOD

**Authentication Pages Found (4/4):**
- `/app/login/page.tsx` - Login page with form validation
- `/app/register/page.tsx` - User registration
