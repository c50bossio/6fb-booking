# Role-Based Dashboard Routing Implementation

## Summary
Implemented role-based dashboard routing to automatically redirect users to their appropriate dashboard based on their role after login.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Login Page (`/app/login/page.tsx`)
- Added import for `getProfile` and `getDefaultDashboard`
- Modified `handleSubmit` to fetch user profile after successful login
- Uses `getDefaultDashboard()` to determine the correct dashboard URL based on user role
- Falls back to `/dashboard` if profile fetch fails

### 2. Updated Dashboard Page (`/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- Added import for `getDefaultDashboard`
- Added role-based redirect logic after fetching user data
- Admins and super_admins are automatically redirected to `/admin`
- Prevents admins from having to manually navigate to their dashboard

### 3. Updated Admin Page (`/app/admin/page.tsx`)
- Fixed role check to accept both 'admin' and 'super_admin' roles
- Previously only 'admin' role was allowed

### 4. Updated ProtectedRoute Component (`/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`)
- Added import for `getDefaultDashboard`
- Updated fallback button to use role-based dashboard URL

## Role-Based Dashboard Mapping
- **admin** → `/admin`
- **super_admin** → `/admin`
- **barber** → `/dashboard`
- **user** → `/dashboard`

## Testing
Created `test-role-routing.js` script to verify the role-based routing logic works correctly for all user roles.

## Benefits
1. Better user experience - users are automatically taken to their appropriate dashboard
2. Consistent behavior across the application
3. Admins no longer need to manually navigate to `/admin` after login
4. Clear separation of dashboards based on user roles
