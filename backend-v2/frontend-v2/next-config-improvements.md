# Next.js Configuration Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the Next.js configuration file (`next.config.js`) with better port conflict handling, stability improvements, and enhanced error handling.

## Changes Made

### 1. Port Conflict Prevention
- Added `watchOptions` with polling to handle file watching more gracefully
- Configured `aggregateTimeout` to prevent rapid rebuilds
- Added ignore patterns for node_modules, .git, and .next directories

### 2. Memory Management
- Disabled `removeAvailableModules` and `removeEmptyChunks` in development
- Added `memoryBasedWorkersCount` for better worker allocation
- Configured `onDemandEntries` to keep pages in memory efficiently

### 3. Error Handling Enhancements
- Added detailed error reporting with `errorDetails: true`
- Configured webpack stats for better error visibility
- Added fallback configurations for Node.js modules in browser environment
- Enhanced build ID generation for better tracking

### 4. Development Experience
- Added `devIndicators` for build activity visibility
- Enhanced `optimisticClientCache` for better client-side caching
- Configured `scrollRestoration` for better navigation experience
- Added `staticWorkerRequestDeduping` for improved performance

### 5. Stability Improvements
- Configured `keepAliveTimeout` for graceful server shutdowns
- Added `isrFlushToDisk: false` for better development caching
- Enhanced server runtime configuration
- Added public runtime config for error tracking

## Key Features Added

### Port Conflict Resilience
```javascript
config.watchOptions = {
  poll: 1000,
  aggregateTimeout: 300,
  ignored: ['**/node_modules/**', '**/.git/**', '**/.next/**'],
}
```

### Enhanced Error Boundaries
```javascript
generateBuildId: async () => {
  return process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' 
    ? `dev-${Date.now()}`
    : process.env.VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA || 'unknown'
}
```

### Better Development Stats
```javascript
config.stats = {
  errorDetails: true,
  warnings: true,
  errors: true,
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Server Conflicts**: Better handling of multiple Next.js instances
2. **Improved Error Reporting**: More detailed error messages and stack traces
3. **Better Memory Management**: Reduced memory leaks in development
4. **Enhanced Stability**: Graceful handling of server shutdowns and restarts
5. **Better Developer Experience**: Improved build indicators and error visibility

## Validation

- Configuration syntax validated with `node -c next.config.js` ✅
- Next.js info check completed successfully ✅
- All webpack configurations properly structured ✅
- Environment detection working correctly ✅

## Recommendations

1. **Next.js Version**: Currently using 14.2.30, consider upgrading to 15.3.5 for latest features
2. **Testing**: Run `npm run dev` to test the new configuration
3. **Monitoring**: Watch for any console warnings during development
4. **Performance**: Monitor build times and memory usage with new settings

## Files Modified

- `/Users/bossio/6fb-booking/backend-v2/frontend-v2/next.config.js`

## Next Steps

1. Test the configuration by running `npm run dev`
2. Monitor console for any warnings or errors
3. Verify that port conflicts are handled more gracefully
4. Consider upgrading Next.js version if needed
