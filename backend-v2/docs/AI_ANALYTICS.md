## Privacy & Consent Management

### Consent Requirements

Before accessing AI analytics features, users must provide explicit consent:

```http
POST /api/v1/ai-analytics/consent
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "consent_types": [
    "benchmarking_participation",
    "predictive_analytics",
    "performance_insights"
  ]
}
```

### Data Anonymization

The system employs advanced anonymization techniques:

- **k-anonymity**: Ensures groups of at least k users share similar characteristics
- **Differential Privacy**: Adds controlled noise to prevent individual identification
- **Data Aggregation**: Only aggregated insights are shared, never individual data points
- **Temporal Separation**: Real-time data is separated from historical analysis

### Opt-Out Options

Users can revoke consent at any time:

```http
DELETE /api/v1/ai-analytics/consent
```

## Implementation Guide

### Frontend Integration

```typescript
// Example React component for AI insights
import { useAIAnalytics } from '@/hooks/useAIAnalytics';

function AIInsightsDashboard() {
  const { 
    benchmark, 
    forecast, 
    isLoading, 
    error 
  } = useAIAnalytics();

  return (
    <div className="ai-insights">
      <BenchmarkCard data={benchmark} />
      <ForecastChart data={forecast} />
      <RecommendationsList />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Service Usage

```python
# Example service integration
from services.ai_benchmarking_service import AIBenchmarkingService
from services.predictive_modeling_service import PredictiveModelingService

async def get_user_insights(user_id: int, db: Session):
    # Check consent
    if not check_ai_analytics_consent(user_id, db):
        raise HTTPException(403, "AI analytics consent required")
    
    # Get benchmarks
    benchmark_service = AIBenchmarkingService(db)
    benchmarks = await benchmark_service.get_user_benchmarks(user_id)
    
    # Get predictions
    prediction_service = PredictiveModelingService(db)
    forecast = await prediction_service.forecast_revenue(user_id)
    
    return {
        "benchmarks": benchmarks,
        "forecast": forecast
    }
```

- **Resource Monitoring**: Automatic scaling based on demand

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Insufficient Data**: Minimum 3 months of data required for accurate predictions
2. **Consent Not Granted**: Users must explicitly consent to AI analytics
