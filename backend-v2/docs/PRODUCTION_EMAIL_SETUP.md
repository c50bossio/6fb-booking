## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Bounce rate (keep below 2%)
- Spam reports (keep below 0.1%)

### Email Best Practices
1. **Sender Reputation**: Maintain consistent sending patterns
2. **List Hygiene**: Remove bounced emails automatically
3. **Engagement**: Monitor and improve open rates
4. **Compliance**: Include unsubscribe links in marketing emails
5. **Authentication**: Keep SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records updated

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Emails not delivered**
   - Check SendGrid Activity Feed
   - Verify recipient email is valid
   - Check spam folders

2. **403 Forbidden errors**
   - Verify API key is valid
   - Ensure sender is verified
   - Check account permissions

3. **Low delivery rates**
   - Review domain authentication
   - Check sender reputation
   - Analyze bounce reasons

## API Reference

### Send Email
```python
from services.notification_service import NotificationService

service = NotificationService()
result = service.send_email(
    to_email="customer@example.com",
    subject="Welcome to BookedBarber",
    body="<html>...</html>"
)
```

### Email Verification
```python
from utils.email_verification import send_verification_email

send_verification_email(
    email="user@example.com",
    verification_token="token123",
    user_name="John Doe"
)
```

## Security Considerations

1. **API Key Protection**: Never commit API keys to version control
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement sending limits to prevent abuse
3. **Input Validation**: Sanitize all email inputs
4. **HTTPS Only**: Use secure connections for all API calls
5. **Token Security**: Use secure, time-limited verification tokens
