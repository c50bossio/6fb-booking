# Enterprise Franchise Security Architecture
## BookedBarber V2 Enterprise-Scale Security Framework

### Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive enterprise franchise security architecture for BookedBarber V2, designed to secure franchise networks at 100,000+ location scale while maintaining compliance with global regulations (GDPR, CCPA, PCI DSS, SOC 2) and supporting multi-regional deployments.

**Built on Proven Foundation**: This architecture enhances the existing production-ready security system serving 10,000+ users, leveraging established middleware stack, UnifiedUserRole system, and multi-tenancy capabilities.

### 1. Current Security Foundation Analysis

- **Advanced Role System**: UnifiedUserRole with ENTERPRISE_OWNER already implemented
- **Multi-Tenancy Support**: Location-based access control with data isolation
- **Enhanced Security Features**: Rate limiting, request validation, attack pattern detection
- **Production Monitoring**: Sentry integration, security event logging, compliance reporting

#### 1.2 Enterprise Enhancement Requirements
- **Franchise Network Isolation**: Tenant-based data segregation for franchise operations
- **Hierarchical Access Control**: Global to individual location security management
- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Continuous verification and context-aware access
- **Compliance Automation**: Automated regulatory compliance monitoring and reporting
- **Global Scale Security**: Multi-region security orchestration and monitoring

### 2. Enterprise Franchise Security Model

#### 2.1 Hierarchical Security Architecture

```
Global Security Layer (Platform Level)
├── Franchise Network Security (Network Level)
│   ├── Regional Security Policies (Region Level)
│   │   ├── Franchise Group Security (Group Level)
│   │   │   └── Individual Location Security (Location Level)
│   │   │       └── User/Role Security (User Level)
```

#### 2.2 Enhanced Role-Based Access Control (Built on UnifiedUserRole)

**Existing Roles Enhanced for Franchise Scale:**
- `PLATFORM_ADMIN`: Global platform administration across all franchises
- `ENTERPRISE_OWNER`: Franchise network owner (already implemented, enhanced for multi-region)
- `FRANCHISE_ADMIN`: Regional franchise administration and compliance
- `SHOP_OWNER`: Individual location owner (enhanced with franchise network context)
- `SHOP_MANAGER`: Location management (enhanced with regional policy enforcement)

**New Franchise-Specific Roles:**
- `FRANCHISE_NETWORK_ADMIN`: Multi-region franchise network management
- `REGIONAL_COMPLIANCE_OFFICER`: Regional regulatory compliance and audit
- `FRANCHISE_SECURITY_OFFICER`: Network-wide security policy enforcement
- `MULTI_LOCATION_MANAGER`: Cross-location operations within franchise network

#### 2.3 Franchise Data Isolation Model

**Multi-Tenant Architecture Enhancement:**
```python
# Enhanced multi-tenancy model for franchise networks
class FranchiseSecurityContext:
    franchise_network_id: str        # Top-level franchise identifier
    franchise_region_id: str         # Regional subdivision
    franchise_group_id: Optional[str] # Multi-location group
    location_id: int                 # Individual location (existing)
    security_zone: SecurityZone      # GLOBAL, REGIONAL, LOCAL
    compliance_requirements: List[ComplianceStandard]
```

### 3. Enterprise Authentication & Authorization

#### 3.1 Federated Identity Management

**Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration:**
- SAML 2.0 provider integration for enterprise identity providers
- OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for secure mobile and web applications
- Active Directory/LDAP integration for franchise corporate networks
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) with adaptive risk assessment

**Implementation Enhancement:**
```python
# Enhanced authentication middleware for franchise SSO
class FranchiseSSOMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    """Enhanced SSO middleware for franchise identity providers"""
    
    def __init__(self, app, sso_providers: Dict[str, SSOProvider]):
        super().__init__(app)
        self.sso_providers = sso_providers
        self.identity_broker = FranchiseIdentityBroker()
    
    async def dispatch(self, request: Request, call_next):
        # Franchise network detection from domain/tenant
        franchise_context = await self._detect_franchise_context(request)
        
        # Route to appropriate SSO provider
        if franchise_context.requires_sso:
            return await self._handle_sso_authentication(request, franchise_context)
        
        # Fallback to standard authentication
        return await call_next(request)
```

#### 3.2 Zero-Trust Security Model

**Continuous Verification Framework:**
- Context-aware access controls (location, time, device, network)
- Risk-based authentication with machine learning threat detection
- Session management with continuous re-authentication
- Privileged access management (PAM) for franchise administrators

**Enhanced Security Middleware:**
```python
# Zero-trust security enhancement
class ZeroTrustSecurityMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    """Continuous verification and risk assessment"""
    
    async def dispatch(self, request: Request, call_next):
        # Build security context
        security_context = await self._build_security_context(request)
        
        # Risk assessment
        risk_score = await self._calculate_risk_score(security_context)
        
        # Adaptive authentication requirements
        if risk_score > self.config.HIGH_RISK_THRESHOLD:
            return await self._require_additional_verification(request)
        
        # Apply context-based access controls
        await self._apply_contextual_access_controls(request, security_context)

    async def get_encryption_key(self, franchise_context: FranchiseSecurityContext, 
                               data_classification: DataClassification) -> EncryptionKey:
        """Get appropriate encryption key based on franchise context and data sensitivity"""
        
        # Determine key scope based on franchise hierarchy
        if data_classification == DataClassification.GLOBAL:
            return await self.hsm.get_global_key()
        elif data_classification == DataClassification.FRANCHISE_NETWORK:
            return await self.hsm.get_franchise_key(franchise_context.franchise_network_id)
        elif data_classification == DataClassification.REGIONAL:
            return await self.hsm.get_regional_key(franchise_context.franchise_region_id)
