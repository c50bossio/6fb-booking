### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install additional Python packages
pip install httpx[http2] tenacity backoff redis

# Update existing requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Redis Configuration
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
REDIS_PASSWORD=your_redis_password

# API Integration Settings
API_OPTIMIZATION_ENABLED=true
