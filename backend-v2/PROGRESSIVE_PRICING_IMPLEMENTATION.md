# Progressive Pricing Implementation

## Overview

BookedBarber now uses a **progressive/marginal pricing model** where each chair is priced based on its bracket, similar to tax brackets. This creates fair, transparent pricing that rewards growth while preventing gaming of the system.

## Pricing Structure

### Progressive Brackets
- **Chair #1**: $19
- **Chairs #2-3**: $17 each
- **Chairs #4-5**: $15 each
- **Chairs #6-9**: $13 each
- **Chairs #10-14**: $11 each
- **Chairs #15+**: $9 each

### Example Calculations

#### Single Barber (1 chair)
- Chair 1: $19
- **Total: $19/month**

#### Small Shop (4 chairs)
- Chair 1: $19
- Chairs 2-3: 2 Ã— $17 = $34
- Chair 4: 1 Ã— $15 = $15
- **Total: $68/month** ($17/chair average)

#### Multi-Location (30 chairs total)
- First 14 chairs: $190
- Chairs 15-30: 16 Ã— $9 = $144
- **Total: $334/month** ($11.13/chair average)

## Multi-Location Benefits

### Combined Billing Advantage
Organizations with multiple locations benefit from combining their chairs:

**Example**: 3 locations with 10, 8, and 12 chairs
- If billed separately: $146 + $122 + $168 = **$436/month**
- If billed together (30 chairs): **$334/month**
- **Savings: $102/month**

### No Gaming Benefit
There's no advantage to artificially splitting locations:
- 30 chairs in one location: $334
- 30 chairs split into fake locations: Still $334
- The progressive model ensures fair pricing regardless of structure

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Billing Router (`/routers/billing.py`)
- Added `calculate_progressive_price()` function
- Updated all endpoints to use progressive pricing
- Multi-location support with total chair counting
- Returns detailed breakdown of pricing by bracket

#### 2. Subscription Service (`/services/subscription_service.py`)
- Updated to use progressive pricing calculations
- Handles organization hierarchy for billing
- Supports headquarters with child locations

#### 3. API Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/billing/calculate-price` - Returns progressive pricing with breakdown
- `GET /api/v1/billing/plans` - Shows progressive pricing tiers
- All subscription endpoints updated for new model

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. PricingCalculator Component
- Shows real-time progressive pricing
- Optional breakdown display
- Next price break indicator
- Competitor comparison with savings

#### 2. TypeScript Integration
- Updated billing API client
- Progressive pricing helpers
- Type-safe pricing calculations

## API Response Examples

### Price Calculation Response
```json
{
  "chairs_count": 10,
  "monthly_total": 146.00,
  "average_per_chair": 14.60,
  "tier_name": "Growing Business",
  "breakdown": [
    {
      "bracket": "First Chair",
      "chairs": 1,
      "price_per_chair": 19.00,
      "subtotal": 19.00
    },
    {
      "bracket": "Chairs 2-3",
      "chairs": 2,
      "price_per_chair": 17.00,
      "subtotal": 34.00
    },
    // ... more brackets
  ]
}
```

## Business Benefits

### 1. **Fair Scaling**
Each additional chair costs less than the previous one, rewarding business growth.

### 2. **Transparency**
Customers can see exactly how their price is calculated with clear bracket breakdowns.

### 3. **No Location Penalties**
Multi-location businesses aren't penalized - they benefit from volume discounts.

### 4. **Growth Incentive**
Clear price breaks encourage businesses to expand.

### 5. **Simplicity**
No complex rules or location fees - just count total chairs.

## Marketing Messages

- "Your first chair: $19. Your 50th chair: only $9!"
- "Grow from 1 to 100 locations - pay the same per chair"
- "No location fees. No surprises. Just fair pricing that scales."
- "The more you grow, the less each chair costs"

## Technical Implementation Status

âœ… **Completed**:
- Backend progressive pricing calculation
- All billing API endpoints updated
- Frontend PricingCalculator component
- Multi-location chair aggregation
- Comprehensive testing suite
- TypeScript API integration

ðŸš§ **Next Steps**:
- Stripe integration for actual payments
- Billing dashboard with visual breakdown
- Automated invoice generation
- Usage-based billing reports

## Migration Guide

For existing customers:
1. Calculate total chairs across all locations
2. Apply progressive pricing (most will see lower bills)
3. Grandfather any customers who would see increases
4. Communicate savings clearly

## Competitive Advantage

BookedBarber is now the only platform that:
- Uses true progressive pricing (not flat tiers)
- Rewards multi-location growth
- Has no per-location fees
- Provides complete pricing transparency
