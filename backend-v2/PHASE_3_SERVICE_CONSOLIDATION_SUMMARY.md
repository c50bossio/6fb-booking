## üöÄ Usage Examples

### BookingOrchestrator Usage
```python
from services.unified_booking_orchestrator import get_booking_orchestrator

orchestrator = get_booking_orchestrator(db)

# Get cached availability
slots = orchestrator.get_available_slots(
    target_date=date.today(),
    user_timezone="America/New_York"
)

# Create booking with AI recommendations
result = orchestrator.create_booking(
    user_id=123,
    service_name="Haircut",
    appointment_datetime=datetime(2025, 7, 26, 10, 0),
    client_name="John Doe"
)

# AI recommendations included in result
if result["success"]:
    recommendations = result.get("ai_recommendations", [])
```

### PaymentManager Usage
```python
from services.unified_payment_manager import get_payment_manager

manager = get_payment_manager(db)

# Create secure payment intent
result = manager.create_payment_intent(
    amount=45.00,
    user_id=123,
    appointment_id=456
)

# Security validation included automatically
if result["success"]:
    payment_intent_id = result["payment_intent_id"]
else:
    security_flags = result.get("security_flags", [])
```

## üìà Next Steps
