# Payment Gateway Migration Guide
## BookedBarber V2 Multi-Gateway Payment System

This guide covers the migration from the single Stripe payment system to the new multi-gateway system supporting both Stripe and Tilled.com.

## üöÄ Overview

The new payment system provides:
- **Multi-Gateway Support**: Stripe and Tilled.com integration
- **Intelligent Routing**: Automatic gateway selection based on cost, success rate, and other factors
- **Failover Capability**: Automatic fallback if primary gateway fails
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing payment code continues to work
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Real-time gateway health and performance tracking

## üìã Migration Checklist

### Phase 1: Environment Setup (Week 1)

#### Backend Configuration
1. **Add Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # .env file additions
   TILLED_API_KEY=your_tilled_api_key
   TILLED_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_tilled_webhook_secret
   TILLED_ACCOUNT_ID=your_tilled_account_id
   
   # Optional: Gateway preferences
   PREFER_TILLED=true
   PAYMENT_SELECTION_STRATEGY=lowest_cost
   PAYMENT_HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL=300
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Backend dependencies (if not already installed)
   pip install aiohttp  # For Tilled HTTP client
   ```

3. **Database Migration** (if needed)
   ```bash
   # No database schema changes required
   # Existing payment tables support multi-gateway
   ```

#### Frontend Configuration
4. **Update Frontend Environment**
   ```bash
   # .env.local additions (optional)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_GATEWAY_SELECTION=true
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_GATEWAY=tilled
   ```

### Phase 2: Code Integration (Week 2)

#### Backend Integration
1. **Add Enhanced Payment Router**
   ```python
   # In main.py, add the enhanced payment router
   from routers.enhanced_payments import router as enhanced_payments_router
   app.include_router(enhanced_payments_router, prefix="/api/v1")
   ```

2. **Initialize Gateway System**
   ```python
   # Add to application startup
   from services.payment_gateways.config_manager import get_config_manager
   
   @app.on_event("startup")
   async def startup_event():
       # Validate payment gateway configuration
       config_manager = get_config_manager()
       issues = config_manager.validate_config()
       if issues['errors']:
           logger.error(f"Payment gateway configuration errors: {issues['errors']}")
   ```

#### Frontend Integration
3. **Update Payment Components**
   ```typescript
   // Replace existing PaymentForm imports
   import { EnhancedPaymentForm } from '@/components/EnhancedPaymentForm';
   
   // Use enhanced form with gateway selection
   <EnhancedPaymentForm
     bookingId={bookingId}
     amount={amount}
     onSuccess={handleSuccess}
     onError={handleError}
     showGatewaySelection={true}
     preferredGateway="tilled"  // Optional
   />
   ```

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation (Week 3)

#### Gateway Testing
1. **Test Gateway Health**
   ```bash
   # Check gateway availability
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
        http://localhost:8000/api/v1/payments/health-check
   ```

2. **Test Payment Flow**
   ```bash
   # Test both gateways
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/payments/create-intent-enhanced \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
        -d '{"booking_id": 123, "preferred_gateway": "tilled"}'
   ```

3. **Run Payment Tests**
   ```bash
   # Backend tests
   pytest tests/test_payment_gateways.py -v
   pytest tests/test_gateway_config_manager.py -v
   
   # Frontend tests
   cd frontend-v2
   npm test -- --testNamePattern="payment"
   ```

### Phase 4: Deployment (Week 4)

#### Staging Deployment
1. **Deploy to Staging**
   ```bash
   # Ensure staging environment has Tilled credentials
   # Deploy backend and frontend changes
   # Test end-to-end payment flows
   ```

2. **Monitor Gateway Performance**
   ```bash
   # Check gateway statistics
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
        http://staging-api.bookedbarber.com/api/v1/payments/gateway-stats
   ```

#### Production Deployment
3. **Gradual Rollout**
   - Start with 10% of traffic to Tilled
   - Monitor for 24 hours
   - Increase to 50% if successful
   - Full rollout after validation

## üîß Configuration Options

### Gateway Selection Strategies

```python
# Environment variable options
PAYMENT_SELECTION_STRATEGY=lowest_cost      # Choose cheapest option
PAYMENT_SELECTION_STRATEGY=highest_success_rate  # Choose most reliable
PAYMENT_SELECTION_STRATEGY=round_robin      # Alternate between gateways
PAYMENT_SELECTION_STRATEGY=a_b_test        # A/B test performance
```

### Gateway Priority Configuration

```python
# Set Tilled as primary, Stripe as fallback
PREFER_TILLED=true

# Or configure priority in code
config_manager.set_gateway_priority(GatewayType.TILLED, 1)
config_manager.set_gateway_priority(GatewayType.STRIPE, 2)
```

### Health Check Configuration

```python
# Health check frequency (seconds)
PAYMENT_HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL=300  # 5 minutes

# Failover settings
DISABLE_PAYMENT_FAILOVER=false  # Enable automatic failover
```

## üîÑ Migration Strategies

### Option 1: Gradual Migration (Recommended)
1. Deploy enhanced payment system alongside existing system
2. Use feature flags to control which users see new system
3. Gradually increase percentage of users on new system
4. Monitor performance and revert if issues arise

### Option 2: A/B Testing Migration
1. Configure `PAYMENT_SELECTION_STRATEGY=a_b_test`
2. Split traffic between Stripe and Tilled
3. Compare conversion rates, success rates, and costs
4. Choose winner based on data

### Option 3: Direct Replacement
1. Replace all payment forms with enhanced versions
2. Set Tilled as preferred gateway
3. Keep Stripe as failover
4. Monitor and adjust as needed

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Payment Success Rate by Gateway**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     gateway_type,
     COUNT(*) as total_payments,
     SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as successful,
     (SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) as success_rate
   FROM payments 
   WHERE created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
   GROUP BY gateway_type;
   ```

2. **Cost Savings Analysis**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     gateway_type,
     SUM(amount) as total_volume,
     SUM(platform_fee) as total_fees,
     AVG(commission_rate) as avg_commission_rate
   FROM payments 
   WHERE created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
     AND status = 'completed'
   GROUP BY gateway_type;
   ```

3. **Gateway Performance**
   ```bash
   # API endpoint for real-time stats
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
        http://localhost:8000/api/v1/payments/gateway-stats
   ```

### Dashboard Integration

```typescript
// Example React component for gateway monitoring
function GatewayDashboard() {
  const [stats, setStats] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/v1/payments/gateway-stats')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(setStats);
  }, []);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Payment Gateway Performance</h2>
      {stats?.gateway_metrics && Object.entries(stats.gateway_metrics).map(([gateway, metrics]) => (
        <div key={gateway}>
          <h3>{gateway}</h3>
          <p>Success Rate: {(metrics.success_rate * 100).toFixed(2)}%</p>
          <p>Avg Response Time: {metrics.average_response_time}ms</p>
          <p>Status: {metrics.is_healthy ? '‚úÖ Healthy' : '‚ùå Unhealthy'}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Webhook Security
1. **Verify Webhook Signatures**
   ```python
   # Both Stripe and Tilled webhooks are verified
   # No additional configuration needed
   ```

2. **API Key Management**
   ```bash
   # Store API keys securely
   # Rotate keys quarterly
   # Use different keys for development/staging/production
   ```

### PCI Compliance
- Both Stripe and Tilled are PCI Level 1 compliant
- No additional PCI requirements for the application
- Card data never touches BookedBarber servers

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Gateway Not Available**
   ```bash
   # Check configuration
   python -c "from services.payment_gateways.config_manager import get_config_manager; print(get_config_manager().get_enabled_gateways())"
   
   # Validate API keys
   curl -X GET https://api.tilled.com/v1/accounts/self \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $TILLED_API_KEY"
   ```

2. **Payment Intent Creation Fails**
   ```python
   # Check logs for specific error
   tail -f backend-v2/app.log | grep "payment_intent"
   
   # Test individual gateway
   from services.payment_gateways import PaymentGatewayFactory, GatewayType
   gateway = PaymentGatewayFactory.create_gateway(GatewayType.TILLED, config)
   result = await gateway.health_check()
   ```

3. **Frontend Gateway Selection Not Working**
   ```typescript
   // Check if gateways API is returning data
   fetch('/api/v1/payments/gateways')
     .then(res => res.json())
     .then(console.log);
   
   // Verify environment variables
   console.log('Gateway selection enabled:', process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_GATEWAY_SELECTION);
   ```

### Rollback Procedure

If issues arise during migration:

1. **Immediate Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Disable Tilled gateway
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/payments/gateway/tilled/disable \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"
   ```

2. **Revert to Original Payment Form**
   ```typescript
   // Replace EnhancedPaymentForm with original PaymentForm
   import PaymentForm from '@/components/PaymentForm';
   ```

3. **Monitor Recovery**
   ```bash
   # Check that Stripe payments are working
   curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/payments/health-check
   ```
