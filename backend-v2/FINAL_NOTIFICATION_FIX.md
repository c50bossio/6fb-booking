# 🎯 Final Notification Button Fix

## 🔍 Issue Found
Based on your screenshot, the notification dropdown was appearing **behind the calendar content** due to a z-index hierarchy conflict.

## 🛠️ Root Cause
In `globals.css`, there's a `.drag-preview` class with:
```css
.drag-preview {
  z-index: 9999;
}
```

Our notification dropdown only had `z-[60]`, which was much lower than this drag preview z-index.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Z-Index Boost
**File**: `components/layout/Header.tsx`
- **Before**: `z-[60]`
- **After**: `z-[10000]`

Both notification and user menu dropdowns now have:
```tsx
z-[10000]
```

This ensures they appear above:
- ✅ Drag preview elements (`z-index: 9999`)
- ✅ Calendar content
- ✅ Any other UI elements

## 🎯 Expected Result

The notification dropdown should now:
1. ✅ **Appear immediately** when clicking the bell icon
2. ✅ **Stay visible** above all calendar content  
3. ✅ **Not get hidden** behind any other elements
4. ✅ **Close properly** when clicking outside

## 🧪 Test This Fix

1. **Click the notification bell** in the top-right corner
2. **Verify the dropdown appears** fully visible
3. **Check it stays above** the calendar and other content
4. **Confirm it closes** when clicking outside

## 📊 Z-Index Hierarchy (Fixed)

| Element | Z-Index | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Notification Dropdown** | `10000` | ✅ **Highest** |
| **User Menu Dropdown** | `10000` | ✅ **Highest** |
| Drag Preview | `9999` | ⬇️ Below dropdowns |
| Other Elements | `< 1000` | ⬇️ Much lower |

The notification dropdown should now be **fully visible and functional**! 🎉
