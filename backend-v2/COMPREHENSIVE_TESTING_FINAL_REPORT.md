**Symptoms:**
- 30+ second timeouts on login attempts
- 403 Forbidden errors on protected endpoints
- JWT token generation failures
- Backend-frontend authentication disconnect

**Remediation (0-48 hours):**
```bash
# 1. Investigation priorities
- Check middleware configuration in main.py
- Test bcrypt performance with sample passwords
- Verify rate limiting configuration
- Check database connection pooling settings

# 2. Test with known patterns
admin@example.com / admin123
barber@example.com / barber123
```

### BLOCKER 2: Security Vulnerabilities
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Impact:** System compromise, credential theft, regulatory violations  
**Issues:**
- Hardcoded Stripe API keys in source code
- Production credentials in .env files
- World-readable sensitive files
- Environment files tracked in version control

**Remediation (0-72 hours):**
```bash
# 1. Immediate secret removal
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch security/credential_validator.py' HEAD

# 2. Environment security
git rm --cached .env .env.staging
echo ".env*" >> .gitignore
chmod 600 .env

# 3. Credential rotation
