# Authentication Flow Fix Summary

## Issue
The `AppLayout.tsx` component was attempting to load user profile data on all pages, including public routes like login, register, and home page. This caused "Failed to load user data" error messages to appear on public pages where authentication is not required.

## Changes Made

### 1. Public Route Detection (AppLayout.tsx)
- Added a list of public routes that don't require authentication:
  - `/` (home page)
  - `/login`
  - `/register`
  - `/forgot-password`
  - `/reset-password` (including dynamic routes like `/reset-password/[token]`)

### 2. Conditional User Profile Loading
- Modified the `loadUserProfile` function to:
  - Skip profile loading entirely on public routes
  - Return early without making API calls on public pages
  - Only attempt to fetch user data on protected routes

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Distinguished between authentication errors (401/403) and actual network errors
- Authentication errors no longer show error messages (expected behavior)
- Network/server errors show a more user-friendly message: "Unable to connect to server. Please try again later."

### 4. Updated Error Display
- Changed error display from red error styling to yellow warning styling
- Added condition to only show errors on non-public routes
- Made the error message less alarming and more informative
- Changed icon from error (X) to warning (triangle) for better UX

## Technical Details

### Modified File
- `/Users/bossio/6fb-booking/backend-v2/frontend-v2/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx`

### Key Changes:
1. Added `isPublicRoute` check using pathname
2. Added `isPublicRoute` dependency to useEffect for proper re-evaluation
3. Conditional error display: `{error && !isPublicRoute ? (...) : children}`
4. Better error categorization in catch block

## Testing
Created a test script (`test_auth_flow.js`) that can be run to verify:
- Public routes don't show authentication errors
- Protected routes properly handle unauthenticated users
- Console errors are monitored for any issues

## Result
Public pages now load without authentication errors, providing a better user experience for visitors who haven't logged in yet. The authentication flow only triggers on pages that actually require user data.
