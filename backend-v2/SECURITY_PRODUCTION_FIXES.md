# CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES FOR PRODUCTION READINESS

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE SECURITY ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 1. Environment Variable Security Vulnerabilities
- **CRITICAL**: NEXTAUTH_SECRET is using dev placeholder value
- **CRITICAL**: SENDGRID_API_KEY is using placeholder value  
- **CRITICAL**: TWILIO credentials are using placeholder values
- **HIGH**: Stripe test keys being used (should validate live keys for production)

### 2. Security Enhancement Opportunities
- Add rate limiting for sensitive endpoints
- Implement input sanitization middleware
- Add API key rotation mechanisms
- Enhance logging for security events
- Add password policy enforcement

### 3. Production Security Checklist
- [ ] Replace all placeholder credentials with production values
- [ ] Enable HTTPS-only mode
- [ ] Implement API key rotation
- [ ] Add comprehensive security monitoring
- [ ] Enable advanced threat detection

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

‚úÖ Already Implemented (Production Ready):
- CSRF protection middleware
- Security headers middleware (HSTS, CSP, XSS protection)
- JWT token security with refresh mechanism
- SQL injection protection via SQLAlchemy ORM
- Input validation via Pydantic schemas
- Authentication monitoring and audit logging
- Suspicious login detection
- MFA support infrastructure
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- Password strength validation

üîß Needs Enhancement:
- Environment variable security validation
- Advanced input sanitization
- API endpoint security scanning
- Production credential management
