  occurrences: 12,
  exclude_holidays: true,
  reschedule_on_conflict: true
};
```

### Managing a Series
```typescript
const seriesAction = {
  action: 'reschedule',
  appointment_id: 123,
  apply_to_series: false,
  new_date: '2025-07-15',
  new_time: '15:00',
  reason: 'Schedule conflict'
};
```

### Creating a Blackout Date
```typescript
const blackout = {
  blackout_date: '2025-07-04',
  reason: 'Holiday - July 4th',
  blackout_type: 'full_day',
  affects_existing_appointments: true,
  auto_reschedule: true
