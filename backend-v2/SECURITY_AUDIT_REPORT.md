# Security Audit Report - Backend V2
## Date: 2025-07-02

## Executive Summary
This report analyzes the security implementations in the backend-v2 codebase, focusing on rate limiting, input validation, and authorization. The audit reveals several strengths and critical gaps in security measures.

## 1. Rate Limiting Analysis

### ✅ EXISTING Rate Limits (Found in `/utils/rate_limit.py`)

#### Protected Endpoints:
- **Authentication:**
  - `/login`: 5/minute (production) | 50/minute (development)
  - `/register`: 3/hour (production) | 20/hour (development)
  - `/password_reset`: 3/hour (production) | 20/hour (development)
  - `/refresh`: 10/minute (production) | 50/minute (development)

- **Payment Operations:**
  - `/payments/create-intent`: 10/minute (production) | 50/minute (development)
  - `/payments/confirm`: 15/minute (production) | 50/minute (development)
  - `/payments/refund`: 5/hour (production) | 20/hour (development)

- **Default:** 60/minute (production) | 200/minute (development)

### ❌ MISSING Rate Limits - Financial Endpoints

#### Critical Unprotected Endpoints in `/routers/payments.py`:
1. `/payments/payouts` (POST) - No rate limit
2. `/payments/payouts/enhanced` (POST) - No rate limit
3. `/payments/stripe-connect/onboard` (POST) - No rate limit
4. `/payments/gift-certificates` (POST) - No rate limit
5. `/payments/reports` (POST) - No rate limit

#### Critical Unprotected Endpoints in `/routers/products.py`:
1. `/products/orders` (POST) - No rate limit for order creation
2. `/products/pos/transactions` (POST) - No rate limit for POS transactions
3. `/products/shopify/oauth/*` - No rate limit on OAuth flows
4. `/products/shopify/sync` (POST) - No rate limit on sync operations

#### Webhook Endpoints:
- `/webhooks/stripe` (POST) - No rate limit (relies on Stripe signature verification only)

## 2. Input Validation Analysis

### ✅ EXISTING Validations

#### Strong Points:
1. **Sanitization Functions** (`/utils/sanitization.py`):
   - `sanitize_html()` - Uses bleach library with whitelist approach
   - `sanitize_plain_text()` - HTML escaping for non-HTML content
   - `sanitize_decimal()` - Numeric validation with bounds checking (-$1B to $1B)
   - `sanitize_integer()` - Integer validation with 32-bit bounds
   - `sanitize_filename()` - Prevents directory traversal
   - `sanitize_url()` - Prevents javascript: and data: schemes

2. **Schema Validations** (`/schemas_new/product.py`):
   - Commission rate: Properly validated (0-1 range) with `Field(..., ge=0, le=1)`
   - Price fields: Non-negative validation with `Field(..., ge=0)`
   - String length limits: Applied to most string fields
   - Quantity validations: Positive integer requirements

3. **Product Router Implementation**:
   - Consistently applies sanitization before database operations
   - Uses typed Pydantic schemas for request/response validation

### ❌ MISSING Validations

1. **Currency Validation**:
   - Currency field defaults to "USD" but accepts ANY string
   - No validation against supported currency codes
   - No normalization of currency codes (e.g., "usd" vs "USD")

2. **Missing Input Sanitization in Other Routers**:
   - Payment routers don't use sanitization functions
   - No validation on webhook payloads beyond signature verification

3. **Business Logic Validations**:
   - No validation that commission_amount = price * commission_rate
   - No validation that order totals match sum of line items
   - No validation on maximum order amounts

## 3. Authorization Analysis

### ✅ EXISTING Authorization

1. **Role-Based Checks**:
   - Refund endpoint: Restricted to admin/barber roles
   - Commission reports: Barbers can only view their own data
   - Payout preview: Admin/super_admin only

2. **User-Based Checks**:
   - Payment intents: Verified appointment belongs to current user
   - Commission filtering: Applied based on user role and ID

### ❌ MISSING Authorization - Critical Gaps

1. **No Location-Based Access Control**:
   - Users can create products for ANY location_id
   - No verification that user has access to specified location
   - Orders can be created for any location without permission checks
   - Inventory can be modified for any location

2. **Missing Multi-Location Permission System**:
   - No middleware or utility function to verify location access
   - No location_permissions table or model
   - No checks like: `verify_user_location_access(user_id, location_id)`

3. **Cross-User Data Access**:
   - No verification on customer_id in orders
   - No checks on barber_id assignments in transactions
   - Products can reference any location without ownership verification

## 4. Additional Security Concerns

### SQL Injection Risk: LOW
- Using SQLAlchemy ORM with parameterized queries
- Direct SQL usage appears minimal

### XSS Risk: MEDIUM
- Frontend sanitization not verified in this audit
- Backend provides good HTML sanitization
- JSON responses should be safe if frontend handles properly

### CSRF Risk: UNKNOWN
- CSRF protection not visible in this audit
- Depends on frontend implementation

## 5. Recommendations

### CRITICAL - Implement Immediately:

1. **Add Rate Limiting to Financial Endpoints**:
```python
# In /utils/rate_limit.py, add:
payout_rate_limit = limiter.limit("5/hour")
order_rate_limit = limiter.limit("30/minute")
pos_transaction_rate_limit = limiter.limit("100/minute")
oauth_rate_limit = limiter.limit("10/hour")
```

2. **Implement Location-Based Authorization**:
```python
# Create /utils/location_auth.py
def verify_user_location_access(user: User, location_id: int, db: Session) -> bool:
    """Verify user has access to the specified location"""
    # Implementation needed
```

3. **Add Currency Validation**:
```python
# In schemas, add:
SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES = ["USD", "CAD", "EUR", "GBP"]

@validator('currency')
def validate_currency(cls, v):
    if v.upper() not in SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES:
        raise ValueError(f'Currency must be one of {SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES}')
    return v.upper()
```

### HIGH Priority:

1. **Add Financial Limits**:
   - Maximum order amount validation
   - Maximum payout amount validation
   - Daily/monthly limits per user

2. **Implement Audit Logging**:
   - Log all financial transactions
   - Log all permission-related actions
   - Log failed authorization attempts

3. **Add Webhook Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement per-source IP rate limiting
   - Add webhook replay attack prevention

### MEDIUM Priority:

1. **Enhance Input Validation**:
   - Add phone number format validation
   - Add email validation beyond basic format
   - Add postal/zip code validation

2. **Implement Data Access Patterns**:
   - Create secure query builders that enforce location access
   - Add row-level security at the database level

## Conclusion

The codebase has a solid foundation for security with good input sanitization and some rate limiting. However, critical gaps exist in:
1. Rate limiting for financial endpoints
2. Location-based authorization
3. Currency and business logic validation

These gaps could allow:
- Abuse of payout/order creation endpoints
- Unauthorized access to other locations' data
- Invalid currency transactions

Immediate action is recommended on the CRITICAL items listed above.
