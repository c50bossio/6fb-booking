## New Unified Documentation

All content from these files has been consolidated into:
**`/Users/bossio/6fb-booking/backend-v2/CALENDAR_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md`**

This comprehensive guide provides:
1. **Single Source of Truth** - All calendar information in one place
2. **Better Organization** - Logical structure with clear sections
3. **Improved Navigation** - Comprehensive table of contents
4. **Easier Maintenance** - Updates only needed in one file
5. **Better Discovery** - All related information together

## Specialized Documentation Kept Separate

The following files were kept separate due to their specialized focus:
- `CALENDAR_EXPORT_ENHANCEMENTS.md` - Detailed export functionality
- `CALENDAR_ACCESSIBILITY_AUDIT.md` - WCAG compliance details

## Benefits of Consolidation

1. **Reduced Duplication**: ~15 files → 3 well-organized files
2. **Single Source of Truth**: One comprehensive calendar reference  
3. **Better Maintenance**: Update once instead of multiple files
4. **Improved Discovery**: All calendar info in predictable location
5. **Cleaner Repository**: Less clutter, better organization

## Archive Safety

These files are archived (not deleted) to maintain git history and allow reference if needed. Content has been preserved in the consolidated guide.
