# Navigation Optimization Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive navigation optimization for the 6FB Booking app, eliminating redundancies and improving user experience across all device types.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Centralized Navigation Configuration
- **File**: `/lib/navigation.ts`
- Created a single source of truth for all navigation items
- Includes role-based filtering and TypeScript types
- Supports hierarchical navigation with expandable sections
- Contains quick actions for each user role

### 2. Header Component Refactoring
- **File**: `/components/layout/Header.tsx`
- Removed hardcoded navigation items
- Now uses `getUserMenuItems()` from centralized config
- Maintains all existing functionality (search, notifications, theme toggle)
- User menu automatically adjusts based on role

### 3. Sidebar Component Update
- **File**: `/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`
- Replaced local `getNavigationItems()` with `filterNavigationByRole()`
- Uses centralized navigation configuration
- Preserves all UI features (collapsible, expandable sections, active states)
- Added support for "New" badges and descriptions

### 4. Mobile Navigation Enhancement
- **File**: `/components/layout/MobileNavigation.tsx`
- Limited bottom tabs to 5 items (4 main + 1 "More")
- Integrated with centralized navigation config
- Added "More" tab that opens the new MobileDrawer

### 5. New MobileDrawer Component

- Features:
  - Sliding animation from left
  - Gesture support (swipe to close)
  - Search functionality
  - Quick actions grid
  - User profile section
  - Sign out button

### 6. Quick Actions Component
