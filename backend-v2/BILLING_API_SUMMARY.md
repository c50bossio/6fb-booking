## Pricing Tiers Implemented

| Chairs | Price/Chair | Tier Name | Key Features |
|--------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | $19 | Solo Barber | Basic features |
| 2-3 | $17 | Small Studio | + Staff management |

## Key Features

1. **Chair-based Pricing**: Automatic tier calculation based on chair count
2. **Annual Discount**: 20% off for annual billing
3. **Permission Integration**: Uses unified permission system for access control
4. **Organization Support**: Works with both individual barbers and organizations
5. **Mock Stripe Integration**: Ready for real Stripe integration
6. **Proration Support**: Calculates prorated amounts for mid-cycle changes

## Security

- All endpoints require authentication
- Billing management endpoints require `billing_access` permission
- Organization-level permissions checked for multi-location setups
- Follows unified role hierarchy (SHOP_OWNER, ENTERPRISE_OWNER, etc.)

## Integration Points

1. **Organization Model**: Uses `Organization.chairs_count` for pricing
2. **User Permissions**: Integrates with `UnifiedPermissions` system
3. **Stripe Ready**: Mock subscription IDs ready for Stripe Connect
4. **Audit Logging**: Logs all billing operations

## Testing

Use the provided `test_billing_endpoints.py` script to test all endpoints:

```bash
# Start the server
uvicorn main:app --reload

# In another terminal (with valid auth token)
python test_billing_endpoints.py
```

## Next Steps for Production

1. Replace mock Stripe operations with real Stripe API calls
2. Add webhook endpoints for Stripe events
3. Implement real proration calculations
4. Add invoice generation
5. Add payment method management endpoints
6. Add billing history endpoints
7. Implement usage-based billing for add-ons
