## 🔧 Implementation Commands

### Setup Test Environment
```bash
cd backend-v2
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pytest-cov pytest-mock pytest-asyncio
```

### Run Coverage Analysis
```bash
python -m pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Fix Broken Tests First
```bash
# Fix syntax errors in test files
python -m py_compile auth_debug_test.py
python -m py_compile test_calendar_view.py
# Continue for all broken test files
```

### Create Tests Using Templates
```bash
# Use the testing templates created earlier:
cp testing-templates/backend_test_template.py tests/unit/test_new_module.py
# Customize for specific module
```
