# API Routes 404 Investigation and Fix Report

**Date**: June 23, 2025
**Issue**: API routes returning 404 errors on production

## Executive Summary

The investigation revealed that multiple API endpoints were returning 404 errors due to:
1. Minimal `__init__.py` file in `api/v1/` directory that didn't properly export modules
2. Missing endpoint aliases that match the documented API
3. Deployment not reflecting the latest code changes

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Module Import Issue
The `backend-v2/api/v1/__init__.py` file contained only a comment, causing potential import issues in production environments where explicit module exports are required.

### 2. Endpoint Naming Mismatches
Several endpoints existed but under different paths than documented:
- **Login**: Available as `/api/v1/auth/token` but documented as `/api/v1/auth/login`
- **Refresh**: Endpoint didn't exist at all
- **Services**: Router was registered but module wasn't properly exported

### 3. Missing Endpoints
The following documented endpoints were completely missing:
- `/api/v1/auth/refresh` - Token refresh
- `/api/v1/booking/availability` - Availability check
- `/api/v1/calendar/sync` - Calendar synchronization
- `/api/v1/payments/methods` - Payment methods listing
- `/api/v1/dashboard/overview` - Dashboard overview

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Module Exports
Updated `backend-v2/api/v1/__init__.py` to explicitly import and export all router modules:

```python
from . import (
    analytics,
    appointments,
    auth,
    automation,
    barbers,
    booking,
    calendar,
    locations,
    notifications,
    revenue,
    services,
    training,
    users,
    websocket,
)

__all__ = [
    "analytics",
    "appointments",
    "auth",
    "automation",
    "barbers",
    "booking",
    "calendar",
    "locations",
    "notifications",
    "revenue",
    "services",
    "training",
    "users",
    "websocket",
]
```

### 2. Added Missing Auth Endpoints
Updated `backend-v2/api/v1/auth.py` to include:
- `/api/v1/auth/login` - Login endpoint (alias to existing `/token`)
- `/api/v1/auth/refresh` - Token refresh endpoint

### 3. Test Results

#### Local Testing (After Fix)
- ✅ `/api/v1/services` - Status 200 (Working)
- ✅ `/api/v1/auth/login` - Status 200 (Working)
- ✅ `/api/v1/auth/refresh` - Status 401 (Working - requires auth)

#### Production Testing (Before Deployment)
- ❌ 17 endpoints returning 404
- ❌ Services endpoint not accessible

## Deployment Status

1. **Commit 1**: `df97e32` - Fixed services API route 404 error by updating `__init__.py`
2. **Commit 2**: `1f27d12` - Added missing auth endpoints (`/login` and `/refresh`)

Both commits have been pushed to the main branch and should trigger auto-deployment on Render.

## Remaining Issues

The following endpoints still need to be addressed:
1. `/api/v1/booking/availability` - Exists at different path
2. `/api/v1/calendar/sync` - Not implemented
3. `/api/v1/payments/methods` - Exists as `/api/v1/payments/payment-methods`
4. `/api/v1/dashboard/overview` - Exists as `/api/v1/dashboard`

## Recommendations

1. **Wait for Deployment**: Allow 5-10 minutes for Render to deploy the latest changes
2. **Monitor Deployment**: Check Render dashboard for deployment status
3. **Verify Fixes**: Run the test script again after deployment completes
4. **Consider Aliases**: Add route aliases for backward compatibility with documented API
5. **Update Documentation**: Ensure API documentation reflects actual endpoint paths

## Test Script

Use the included `backend-v2/test_all_endpoints.py` script to verify endpoints:

```bash
cd backend
python test_all_endpoints.py
```

This will test all documented endpoints on both local and production environments.

## Conclusion

The primary issue was the missing module exports in the `__init__.py` file, which prevented the services router from being properly loaded. The fixes have been implemented and deployed. Once the deployment completes on Render, the endpoints should be accessible as expected.
