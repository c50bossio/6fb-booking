## üí∞ Pricing & Revenue Rules

### **Minimum Service Standards**
**Rule**: All services must meet minimum quality and pricing thresholds
**Implementation**:
```python
# Service validation rules
def validate_service_pricing(service):
    minimum_prices = {
        'haircut': 25.00,
        'beard_trim': 15.00,
        'premium_cut': 50.00,
        'consultation': 0.00  # Free consultations allowed
    }
    
    if service.base_price < minimum_prices.get(service.category, 20.00):
        raise ValidationError("Service price below 6FB minimum standards")
```

### **Value-Based Pricing Enforcement**
**Rule**: Platform must support and encourage value-based rather than time-based pricing
**Implementation**:
- Service pricing based on value delivered, not duration
- Premium service tiers must be prominently featured
- Bulk discounting discouraged in favor of value packages
- Price comparison tools should emphasize value, not lowest price

### **Revenue Per Client Tracking**
**Rule**: System must track and optimize for increasing revenue per client
**Implementation**:
```python
def calculate_client_value_metrics(client_id):
    return {
        'average_appointment_value': get_avg_appointment_value(client_id),
        'lifetime_value': calculate_lifetime_value(client_id),
        'last_12_months_revenue': get_revenue_by_period(client_id, 12),
        'value_trend': calculate_value_trend(client_id),
        'upsell_opportunities': identify_upsell_potential(client_id)
    }
```

## üë• Client Relationship Rules

### **Client Segmentation Standards**
**Rule**: Clients must be categorized and treated according to 6FB relationship principles
**Implementation**:
```python
CLIENT_SEGMENTS = {
    'VIP': {
        'criteria': 'revenue_per_year >= 1000 AND loyalty_score >= 8',
        'benefits': ['priority_booking', 'exclusive_services', 'personal_consultation'],
        'communication_frequency': 'weekly'
    },
    'PREMIUM': {
        'criteria': 'revenue_per_year >= 500 AND visits_per_year >= 6',

        'communication_frequency': 'bi_weekly'
    },
    'REGULAR': {
        'criteria': 'visits_per_year >= 3',
        'benefits': ['standard_booking', 'loyalty_points'],
        'communication_frequency': 'monthly'
    },
    'NEW': {
        'criteria': 'visits_total <= 2',
        'benefits': ['welcome_package', 'consultation'],
        'communication_frequency': 'weekly_onboarding'
    }
}

### **Client Retention Thresholds**
**Rule**: System must alert when client relationship health declines
**Implementation**:
```python

    risk_factors = {
        'last_visit_days': days_since_last_visit(client.id),
        'booking_frequency_decline': calculate_frequency_trend(client.id),
        'average_spend_decline': calculate_spend_trend(client.id),
        'communication_engagement': get_engagement_score(client.id)
    }
    
    if risk_factors['last_visit_days'] > 60:
        trigger_retention_campaign(client.id, 'extended_absence')
    
    return calculate_retention_score(risk_factors)
```
