# Dashboard Demo Mode Implementation

## Overview
The 6FB Booking Platform dashboard now works fully in demo mode without requiring authentication. All features display realistic mock data to showcase the application's capabilities.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Public Demo API Endpoints
Created new public endpoints in `/api/v1/endpoints/public_dashboard.py`:
- `/api/v1/dashboard/demo/appointments/today` - Returns realistic daily appointments
- `/api/v1/dashboard/demo/barbers` - Returns barber list with payment connections
- `/api/v1/dashboard/demo/analytics/overview` - Returns analytics metrics
- `/api/v1/dashboard/demo/calendar/events` - Returns calendar events for any date range

### 2. Frontend Demo Mode Support
Updated all main pages to work without authentication:

#### Dashboard Page (`/dashboard`)
- Shows demo user info automatically
- Fetches appointments and barber stats from demo endpoints
- Displays realistic metrics (revenue, appointments, active barbers)
- Calendar component loads dynamic demo events
- TrafftIntegration shows mock sync activity

#### Barbers Page (`/barbers`)
- Falls back to demo data when not authenticated
- Shows 4 demo barbers with realistic stats
- Displays payment connection status (Stripe/Square)
- All features remain interactive (add, edit, delete show appropriate messages)

#### Analytics Page (`/analytics`)
- Generates revenue data based on selected time range
- Shows barber performance rankings
- Displays realistic growth metrics
- Charts update dynamically with time range selection

### 3. Realistic Mock Data
All demo data is carefully crafted to be realistic:
- Appointments follow typical barbershop patterns
- Revenue varies by day of week (closed Sundays, busy Fridays/Saturdays)
- Barber names, services, and prices reflect real barbershop operations
- Time slots and durations are industry-standard
- 6FB scores and metrics use believable ranges

   ```bash
   cd backend
   python main.py
   ```

2. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
