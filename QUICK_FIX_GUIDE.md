# 🔧 Quick Fix Guide - Client Management System

## 🚨 Critical Issue: SquareAccount Import Problem

### **Problem**
The `SquareAccount` model is defined in `models/square_payment.py` but not imported in `models/__init__.py`, causing SQLAlchemy relationship errors when trying to use the client management system.

### **Root Cause**
```python
# In models/barber.py line 62:
square_account = relationship("SquareAccount", back_populates="barber", uselist=False)

# SquareAccount exists in models/square_payment.py but is not imported
```

### **Quick Fix (2 minutes)**

**Step 1:** Update `models/__init__.py`
```python
# Add this import at the top section:
from .square_payment import SquarePayment, SquarePayout, SquareAccount

# Add to __all__ list:
__all__ = [
    # ... existing items ...
    "SquarePayment",
    "SquarePayout",
    "SquareAccount",
]
```

**Step 2:** Test the fix
```bash
cd /Users/bossio/6fb-booking/backend
python seed_client_data.py
```
