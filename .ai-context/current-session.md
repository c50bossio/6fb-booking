# Current Session - 6FB Booking Platform

## Session Date: June 19, 2025

### Current Status
- **Project**: 6FB Booking - Barber shop booking and management platform
- **Tech Stack**:
  - Backend: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL/SQLite
  - Frontend: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
  - Infrastructure: Sentry monitoring, Stripe payments, Trafft integration
- **Current Branch**: main
- **Last Working On**: Fixed import errors in sync_status.py and dashboard.py

### Recent Progress
- Fixed ModuleNotFoundError by updating imports from `middleware.auth` to `utils.auth_decorators`
- Verified Sentry integration is working correctly
- Backend server was down due to import errors (now fixed)

### Current State
- **What Works**:
  - Sentry error monitoring configured and tested
  - Database schema properly initialized
  - Core API structure in place
- **Current Issues**:
  - Backend server needs restart after import fixes
  - Trafft webhook integration status unknown
  - No rate limiting on API endpoints (SECURITY RISK)
- **Immediate Next Steps**:
  1. Restart backend server and verify it runs
  2. Test API endpoints for functionality
  3. Implement rate limiting on all endpoints
  4. Verify Trafft webhook security

### Files Recently Modified
- `/backend/api/v1/endpoints/sync_status.py`
- `/backend/api/v1/endpoints/dashboard.py`

### Security Concerns Identified
- ⚠️ No rate limiting on API endpoints
- ⚠️ Missing CAPTCHA on authentication endpoints
- ⚠️ Webhook endpoints may lack signature verification
- ⚠️ Debug endpoints exposed (e.g., /sentry-debug)

### Production Readiness Status
- ❌ Rate limiting not implemented
- ❌ Input validation needs review
- ✅ Sentry monitoring configured
- ❌ Backup strategy not documented
- ❌ CI/CD pipeline not visible
