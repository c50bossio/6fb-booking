# Booking Calendar Integration Test Guide

## What was updated:

1. **BookingCalendar Component Integration**
   - Updated `/frontend/src/app/book/[shopId]/booking/page.tsx` to use the new BookingCalendar component
   - Replaced the basic HTML date input with the calendar component

2. **Layout Improvements**
   - Desktop: Side-by-side layout with calendar on the left and time slots on the right
   - Mobile: Stacked layout with calendar on top and time slots below
   - Time slots are shown in a separate card container

3. **Monthly Availability**
   - Added `loadMonthlyAvailability` function that fetches availability for the next 3 months
   - Available dates are shown with green dots on the calendar
   - Availability is loaded when a barber and service are selected

4. **UI Enhancements**
   - Better visual hierarchy with section headers
   - Clear call-to-action when no date is selected
   - Continue button appears only when both date and time are selected
   - Improved navigation with back button properly placed

## How to test:

1. Navigate to `/book/1/booking` (or any shop ID)
2. Select a service
3. Select a barber
4. On the date/time step:
   - Calendar should appear on the left (desktop) or top (mobile)
   - Available dates should show green dots
   - Clicking a date should load time slots on the right/bottom
   - Selecting a time slot should enable the continue button

## Expected behavior:

- Calendar shows current month by default
- Can navigate between months using arrow buttons
- Today's date has a ring indicator
- Selected date has dark background
- Available dates have green dots
- Time slots are grouped by time of day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)
- Responsive layout adjusts for mobile screens
