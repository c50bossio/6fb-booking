# Multi-Location Payment Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive multi-location payment system where each barbershop location can have barbers connect their own payment accounts (Stripe or Square) to receive instant payouts minus commission.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Database Models
- **BarberPaymentModel** (`/backend/models/barber_payment.py`)
  - Added `location_id` field for location-specific payment configurations
  - Added Square OAuth fields: `square_merchant_id`, `square_access_token`, `square_account_verified`
  - Added `payout_method` field for manual payout tracking
  - Supports commission, booth rent, and hybrid payment models

- **Location Model** (`/backend/models/location.py`)
  - Added `payment_platform` field for location payment preference
  - Added `stripe_account_id` for location's Stripe account
  - Added `default_commission_rate` for location-wide commission settings
  - Added `barber_payment_models` relationship

### 2. API Endpoints

- **GET `/locations/summary`** - Get payment summary for all locations
- **POST `/process-location-payment`** - Process split payments at specific locations
- **POST `/oauth-callback-location`** - Handle OAuth callbacks for location-specific connections

#### Payment Splits (`/backend/api/v1/endpoints/barber_payment_splits.py`)
- **POST `/connect-account`** - Start OAuth flow for payment account connection
- **POST `/oauth-callback`** - Handle OAuth completion
- **PUT `/payment-model/{barber_id}`** - Update barber payment configuration
- **POST `/process-payment`** - Process split payments
- **GET `/connected-accounts`** - List all connected accounts
- **POST `/charge-booth-rent/{barber_id}`** - Charge booth rent from connected account

#### Simple Payroll (`/backend/api/v1/endpoints/barber_payroll.py`)

- **GET `/export-payroll`** - Export payroll as CSV

### 3. Payment Flow

1. **Location Setup**
   - Shop owner configures location with preferred payment platform
   - Sets default commission rate for the location

2. **Barber Assignment**
   - Barbers are assigned to specific locations
   - Each barber-location pair can have unique commission/booth rent terms

3. **Account Connection**
   - Barbers connect their own Stripe/Square accounts via OAuth
   - Different accounts can be connected for different locations

4. **Payment Processing**
   - Customer pays full amount
   - Payment automatically splits based on configuration
   - Barber instantly receives their portion (70% default)
   - Shop keeps commission (30% default)

### 4. Key Services
- **PaymentSplitService** - Handles OAuth flows and payment splitting logic
- Supports both Stripe Connect and Square OAuth
- Calculates splits based on payment model (commission vs booth rent)

## Current Status
✅ Multi-location support fully implemented
✅ OAuth flows for both Stripe and Square
✅ Automatic payment splitting
✅ Location-specific barber payment configurations
✅ Database relationships properly configured

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Test the multi-location payment flows
2. Add frontend components for location payment management
3. Implement webhook handlers for payment status updates
4. Add encryption for sensitive OAuth tokens in production
