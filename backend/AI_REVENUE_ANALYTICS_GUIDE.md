cd backend
pip install -r requirements_ai_analytics.txt
```

### 2. Run Database Migration
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### 3. Initialize Analytics
The system automatically starts analyzing data once there are at least 30 days of appointment history.

### 4. Configure Settings
Add to your `.env`:
```
# AI Analytics Settings
ML_MODEL_VERSION=1.0
PREDICTION_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.7
PRICING_OPTIMIZATION_ENABLED=true
```

## Usage Examples

### Get Revenue Patterns
```python
from services.ai_revenue_analytics_service import AIRevenueAnalyticsService

ai_service = AIRevenueAnalyticsService(db)
patterns = ai_service.analyze_revenue_patterns(barber_id, lookback_days=180)

for pattern in patterns:
    print(f"{pattern['pattern_name']}: ${pattern['avg_revenue_impact']}")
```

### Generate Predictions
```python
predictions = ai_service.predict_future_revenue(barber_id, days_ahead=30)

for pred in predictions[:7]:
    print(f"{pred['prediction_date']}: ${pred['predicted_revenue']:.2f}")
```

### Optimize Pricing
```python
pricing_recs = ai_service.optimize_pricing(barber_id)

for rec in pricing_recs:
    print(f"{rec['service_name']}: ${rec['current_price']} â†’ ${rec['recommended_price']}")
    print(f"Expected impact: {rec['expected_revenue_change']}%")
```

## Dashboard Integration

The analytics integrate seamlessly with the existing dashboard:

1. **Executive Dashboard**: High-level KPIs and predictions
2. **Revenue Analytics**: Detailed revenue analysis
3. **Client Analytics**: Segmentation and retention
4. **Performance**: Benchmarking and efficiency
5. **Optimization**: Active recommendations

## Machine Learning Models

### 1. Revenue Forecasting
- **Prophet**: Time series forecasting with seasonality
- **ARIMA**: Alternative forecasting for validation
- **Features**: Historical revenue, seasonality, trends

### 2. Price Elasticity
- **Linear Regression**: Price-demand relationship
- **Optimization**: Scipy minimize for optimal pricing
- **Constraints**: Min/max price boundaries

### 3. Client Segmentation
- **K-Means Clustering**: Behavioral grouping
- **RFM Analysis**: Recency, Frequency, Monetary value
- **Features**: Visit patterns, spend, preferences

### 4. Anomaly Detection
- **Isolation Forest**: Identifies unusual patterns
- **Threshold**: 90th percentile for anomalies

## Best Practices

### 1. Data Quality
- Ensure appointment data is complete
- Mark correct customer types (new/returning)
- Record accurate service revenues and tips

### 2. Regular Updates
- Patterns refresh automatically weekly
- Predictions update daily
- Insights regenerate based on changes

### 3. Implementation
- Start with high-confidence recommendations
- Test pricing changes gradually
- Monitor actual vs predicted results

### 4. Client Privacy
