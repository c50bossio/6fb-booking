  - Unique code generation (format: XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX)
  - Amount tracking (original and remaining balance)
  - Sender and recipient information
  - Status tracking (active, partially_used, fully_used, expired, cancelled)
  - Expiry date management (default 12 months)
  - Personal message support
  - Stripe payment integration fields

- **GiftCertificateRedemption Model**
  - Tracks each redemption transaction
  - Links to appointments
  - Maintains balance history

### 2. Backend API Endpoints (`api/v1/endpoints/gift_certificates.py`)

#### Public Endpoints:

- **Float Revenue**: Money received before service delivered
- **New Customer Acquisition**: Recipients become new customers
- **Seasonal Peaks**: Holiday sales boost (up to 40% in December)
- **Higher Average Transaction**: Gift certificates often exceed typical service prices

## Integration Points

1. **Booking System**: Seamless integration at checkout
2. **Payment System**: Full Stripe integration
3. **Email System**: Automated notifications
4. **Customer Portal**: Dashboard integration
5. **Admin Panel**: Management tools

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Bulk Purchase**: Corporate gift programs
2. **Promotional Campaigns**: Bonus value promotions
3. **Digital Wallet**: Apple/Google Wallet integration
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Detailed redemption analytics
5. **Referral Integration**: Reward gift certificate purchases

## Testing

Test files created:
- `test_gift_certificate_system.py` - Service layer testing
