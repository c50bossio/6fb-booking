# API Routing Structure Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Removed duplicate health endpoint** from `main.py` (line 385-409)
   - The duplicate `/health` endpoint was causing conflicts

2. **Added redirect** from `/health` to `/api/v1/health` for backward compatibility
   - Status code 301 (Permanent Redirect)
   - This ensures existing monitoring tools continue to work

3. **Updated root endpoint** to show correct health check URL
   - Changed from `/health` to `/api/v1/health`

## Current API Structure

### Health Endpoints
- `/` - Root endpoint (returns API info)
- `/health` - Redirects to `/api/v1/health` (backward compatibility)
- `/api/v1/health` - Basic health check
- `/api/v1/health/detailed` - Detailed health check with diagnostics
- `/api/v1/health/live` - Kubernetes liveness probe
- `/api/v1/health/ready` - Kubernetes readiness probe
- `/api/v1/health/metrics` - System metrics
- `/api/v1/health/payments` - Payment system health
- `/api/v1/health/database` - Database health
- `/api/v1/health/security` - Security monitoring
- `/api/v1/uptime` - Simple uptime check

### Services Endpoints
- `/api/v1/services` - GET list of services
- `/api/v1/services/categories` - GET service categories
- `/api/v1/services/{service_id}` - GET specific service
- `/api/v1/services` - POST create service (authenticated)
- `/api/v1/services/{service_id}` - PUT update service (authenticated)
- `/api/v1/services/{service_id}` - DELETE soft delete service (authenticated)

## Testing

Run the test script to verify all routes:
```bash
cd backend
python test_api_routes.py
```

## Notes

- All API endpoints are now properly namespaced under `/api/v1/`
- Health monitoring tools can use either `/health` (redirects) or `/api/v1/health` directly
- The services endpoint should now be accessible at `/api/v1/services`
- Authentication is required for service creation, update, and deletion operations
