Pro Grooming Tips Just for You, {{ client_first_name }}

As a member of the {{ barbershop_name }} family, you deserve to look your best every day—not just when you leave our chair. Here are some insider tips from our master barbers to keep you looking sharp between visits.

✂️ HAIR CARE ESSENTIALS

1. The Right Washing Frequency
Wash your hair 2-3 times per week max. Over-washing strips natural oils, leaving hair dry and unmanageable.

2. Quality Products Matter
Invest in sulfate-free shampoo and a good leave-in conditioner. Your hair will thank you, and your style will last longer.

3. Proper Drying Technique
Pat dry with a microfiber towel, never rub. Use a blow dryer on medium heat with a round brush for volume.

🧔 BEARD MAINTENANCE 101

Daily Beard Oil
Apply 3-4 drops of quality beard oil daily. Work it in from roots to tips to prevent itching and promote healthy growth.

Weekly Deep Clean
Use a dedicated beard wash once a week. Regular shampoo is too harsh and will dry out both your beard and the skin underneath.

Trim Between Visits
Light trimming of stray hairs is okay, but leave the shaping to us. A small mistake can take weeks to fix.
