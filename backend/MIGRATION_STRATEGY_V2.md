## Migration Implementation Plan

### Phase 0 - Setup & Infrastructure (Week 0)

1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Create migration branch
   git checkout -b migration/v2-phase-0-setup
   
   # Setup migration tracking
   mkdir -p backend-v2/migrations
   touch backend-v2/migrations/migration_tracker.json
   ```

2. **Duplication Detection System**
   ```python

           self.existing_features = set()
           self.migration_log = []
       
       def check_feature(self, feature_name: str) -> bool:
           """Check if feature already exists in v2"""
           # Implementation details below
   ```

3. **Automated Testing Framework**
   ```bash
   # backend-v2/tests/migration_tests.py

```

### Duplication Prevention Mechanisms

1. **Feature Registry**
   ```json
   {
     "migrated_features": {
       "auth": {
         "status": "completed",
         "date": "2025-06-28",
         "endpoints": ["/auth/login", "/auth/register"],
         "models": ["User", "MFASettings"],
         "services": ["AuthService", "RBACService"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Automated Checks**
   ```python
   # Pre-migration check
   def pre_migration_check(feature_name: str):
       if feature_exists_in_v2(feature_name):
           raise DuplicationError(f"{feature_name} already migrated")
       
       if has_dependencies(feature_name):
           check_dependencies_migrated(feature_name)
   ```

3. **Migration Script Template**
   ```python
   # migration_scripts/migrate_feature.py
   class FeatureMigrator:
       def __init__(self, feature_name: str):
           self.feature = feature_name
           self.detector = DuplicationDetector()
       
       def migrate(self):
           # 1. Check for duplicates
           if self.detector.check_feature(self.feature):
               raise DuplicationError()
           
           # 2. Migrate models
           self.migrate_models()
           
           # 3. Migrate services
           self.migrate_services()
           
           # 4. Migrate endpoints
           self.migrate_endpoints()
           
           # 5. Run tests
           self.run_tests()
           
           # 6. Update registry
           self.detector.register_feature(self.feature)
   ```

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests per Feature**
   ```python
   # backend-v2/tests/test_[feature].py
   # Comprehensive tests for each migrated feature
   ```

2. **Integration Tests**
   ```python
   # backend-v2/tests/integration/test_phase_[n].py
   # Tests for feature interactions
   ```

3. **Performance Tests**
   ```python
   # backend-v2/tests/performance/test_[feature]_performance.py
   # Ensure no performance regression
   ```

### Automated Migration Tools

1. **Migration Runner**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # scripts/run_migration.sh
   
   PHASE=$1
   FEATURE=$2
   
   # Pre-checks
   python backend-v2/utils/pre_migration_check.py --phase $PHASE --feature $FEATURE
   
   # Run migration
   python backend-v2/migrations/phase_${PHASE}/${FEATURE}_migration.py
   
   # Run tests
   pytest backend-v2/tests/test_${FEATURE}.py
   
   # Update tracker
   python backend-v2/utils/update_migration_tracker.py --feature $FEATURE
   ```

2. **Conflict Detection**
   ```python
   # backend-v2/utils/conflict_detector.py
   def detect_conflicts(new_feature: str):
       conflicts = []
       
       # Check model conflicts
       if has_model_conflicts(new_feature):
           conflicts.append(get_model_conflicts(new_feature))
       
       # Check endpoint conflicts
       if has_endpoint_conflicts(new_feature):
           conflicts.append(get_endpoint_conflicts(new_feature))
       
       # Check service conflicts
       if has_service_conflicts(new_feature):
           conflicts.append(get_service_conflicts(new_feature))
       
       return conflicts
   ```

### Feature Creep Prevention

1. **Strict Scope Definition**
   - Each phase has clearly defined features
   - No additions without approval
   - Focus on exact feature parity first

2. **Automated Scope Checking**
   ```python
   # backend-v2/utils/scope_checker.py
   ALLOWED_FEATURES = {
       "phase_1": ["auth", "booking", "clients"],
       "phase_2": ["calendar", "scheduling", "availability"],
       # etc...
   }
   
   def check_scope(phase: str, feature: str):
       if feature not in ALLOWED_FEATURES.get(phase, []):
           raise ScopeCreepError(f"{feature} not in phase {phase} scope")
   ```

3. **Code Review Checklist**
   - [ ] Feature is in current phase scope
   - [ ] No duplicate functionality
   - [ ] Tests pass
   - [ ] Documentation updated
   - [ ] Migration tracker updated

### Monitoring and Rollback

1. **Migration Dashboard**
   ```python
   # backend-v2/monitoring/migration_dashboard.py
   # Real-time view of migration progress
   ```

2. **Rollback Procedures**
   ```bash
   # scripts/rollback_migration.sh
   FEATURE=$1
   
   # Revert code changes
   git revert $(git log --grep="migrate: $FEATURE" --format="%H")
   
   # Rollback database
   python backend-v2/migrations/rollback.py --feature $FEATURE
   
   # Update tracker
   python backend-v2/utils/update_migration_tracker.py --feature $FEATURE --status rollback
   ```

## Success Metrics

1. **Zero Duplication**: No duplicate code or functionality
2. **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% coverage for migrated features
3. **Performance**: No regression from original implementation
4. **Zero Downtime**: Migration doesn't affect production
5. **Clean Architecture**: Maintainable and scalable code

## Timeline

- **Week 0**: Setup and infrastructure
- **Weeks 1-2**: Phase 1 - Core Features
- **Weeks 3-4**: Phase 2 - Calendar & Scheduling
- **Weeks 5-6**: Phase 3 - Payment & Financial
- **Weeks 7-8**: Phase 4 - Communication & Marketing
- **Weeks 9-10**: Phase 5 - Analytics & Reporting
- **Week 11**: Final testing and optimization
- **Week 12**: Production deployment

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Data Migration Risks**
   - Comprehensive backup strategy
   - Incremental migration with validation
   - Rollback procedures at each step

2. **Integration Risks**
   - Feature flag system for gradual rollout
   - Parallel running of old and new systems
   - Comprehensive integration testing

3. **Performance Risks**
   - Load testing at each phase
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Optimization before moving to next phase

## Conclusion

This migration strategy provides a systematic approach to moving from the current monolithic architecture to a clean, maintainable V2 implementation. By using automated tools, strict scope control, and comprehensive testing, we ensure a successful migration without duplication or feature creep.
