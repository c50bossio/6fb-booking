# SSL certificates should be placed in this directory
# For production, use Let's Encrypt or your certificate provider
# Example files:
# - cert.pem (SSL certificate)
# - key.pem (Private key)
# - chain.pem (Certificate chain - optional)

# For development/testing, you can generate self-signed certificates:
# openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem
