python3 -c 'import secrets; print("SECRET_KEY=" + secrets.token_urlsafe(64))'

# Generate JWT_SECRET_KEY  
python3 -c 'import secrets; print("JWT_SECRET_KEY=" + secrets.token_urlsafe(64))'
```

## üõ°Ô∏è 2. Security Middleware Configuration

The platform includes several security middleware components that are automatically configured based on environment variables:

### Advanced Security Middleware
- Real-time threat detection
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS attack prevention
- Path traversal protection
- Suspicious user agent detection

### Security Headers Middleware
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- HSTS headers
- XSS protection
- Content-type protection
- Frame options

### Rate Limiting Middleware
- Endpoint-specific rate limits
- IP-based rate limiting
- Automatic threat response

---

## üö® 3. Security Monitoring Setup

### Sentry Configuration

1. Create a Sentry project at https://sentry.io
2. Copy the DSN to `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable
3. Configure alert rules in Sentry dashboard

### Security Monitoring Dashboard

Access the security dashboard at:
```
https://your-domain.com/api/v1/security/dashboard
```

### Real-time Alerts

Configure Slack/webhook alerts:
```bash
# Set webhook URL for security alerts
SECURITY_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/SLACK/WEBHOOK
```

---

## üîê 4. Authentication Security

### JWT Configuration

- Tokens expire in 1 hour (production setting)
- Secure secret keys enforced
- Token sanitization in logs
- No token blacklisting (stateless design)

### Password Security

- Minimum 8 characters
- Requires uppercase, lowercase, number, special character
- bcrypt hashing with salt rounds
- Rate limiting on login attempts (5 attempts per 5 minutes)

### Multi-Factor Authentication (Future Enhancement)

```python
# Placeholder for MFA implementation
# Recommended: TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
```

---

## üí≥ 5. Payment Security (PCI DSS Compliance)

### Stripe Integration

‚úÖ **Current Security Measures**:
- Webhook signature verification enforced
- Payment data sanitization in logs
- Amount validation against appointment costs
- Fraud detection with maximum limits ($1000)
- No sensitive payment data stored

### PCI DSS Compliance Checklist

- [ ] Network security requirements met
- [x] Stripe handles card data processing
- [x] Secure data transmission (HTTPS only)
- [x] Access controls implemented
- [x] Security monitoring active
- [x] Regular security testing performed

---

## üåê 6. Network Security

### HTTPS Configuration

**Required**: All production traffic must use HTTPS

### Firewall Rules

**Recommended firewall configuration**:

```bash
# Allow only necessary ports
# Port 443: HTTPS
# Port 22: SSH (restrict to admin IPs)
# Port 5432: PostgreSQL (internal only)

# Example iptables rules
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -s ADMIN_IP -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 5432 -s DB_SERVER_IP -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -j DROP  # Default deny
```

### CDN Configuration (Cloudflare)

```bash
# Enable security features:
# - DDoS protection
# - Web Application Firewall (WAF)
# - Rate limiting
# - SSL/TLS encryption
# - Bot management
```

---

## üìä 7. Database Security

### PostgreSQL Security

```sql
-- Create application user with limited permissions
CREATE USER sixfb_app WITH PASSWORD 'secure_random_password';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE sixfb_production TO sixfb_app;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO sixfb_app;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO sixfb_app;

-- Enable SSL
ssl = on
ssl_cert_file = 'server.crt'
ssl_key_file = 'server.key'
```

### Database Connection Security

```bash
# Use SSL connection string
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db?sslmode=require
```

---

# X-Frame-Options: DENY
# X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
# Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains

# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..20}; do curl https://your-domain.com/api/v1/health; done

# Test authentication
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/v1/auth/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=test&password=test"
