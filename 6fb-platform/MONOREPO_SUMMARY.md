# 6FB Platform Monorepo Summary

## Overview

I've created a comprehensive monorepo structure for the 6FB booking platform that enforces clean architecture and prevents code duplication. This new structure uses Nx for monorepo management and implements strict architectural boundaries.

## Key Features

### 1. **Clean Architecture**
- Clear separation of concerns with defined package boundaries
- Unidirectional dependency flow (UI → Core, never Core → UI)
- Single source of truth for all types and business logic

### 2. **Package Structure**
```
packages/
├── core/    # Shared types, constants, utilities (no dependencies)
├── api/     # FastAPI backend (depends on core)
├── web/     # Next.js app (depends on core, ui)
├── ui/      # Component library (depends on core)
└── mobile/  # React Native app (depends on core, ui)
```

### 3. **Build-time Validation**
- Custom ESLint rules to enforce architecture
- Pre-commit hooks for validation
- Architecture validation script (`npm run validate`)
- Automated dependency checking

### 4. **Development Experience**
- Workspace imports: `import { User } from '@6fb/core'`
- Parallel builds with Nx
- Shared TypeScript configuration
- Centralized dependency management

## Architecture Rules

1. **No Circular Dependencies**
   - Dependencies only flow downward
   - Core has no dependencies on other packages

2. **No Business Logic in UI**
   - UI components must be pure presentational
   - Business logic belongs in API or Core

3. **Single Source of Truth**
   - All types defined once in Core
   - No duplicate type definitions

4. **Typed API Contracts**
   - All API endpoints must use types from Core
   - Ensures frontend/backend consistency

## Custom Tooling

### ESLint Rules
- `no-cross-package-imports`: Prevents invalid imports
- `enforce-dependency-direction`: Ensures proper dependency flow
- `no-duplicate-api-endpoints`: Prevents endpoint duplication
- `no-business-logic-in-ui`: Keeps UI components pure

### Build Guards
- Architecture validation before builds
- Checks for duplicate types
- Validates package structure
- Ensures no business logic in UI

## Migration Path

The migration guide provides a phased approach:
1. **Phase 1**: Setup monorepo structure
2. **Phase 2**: Migrate core types and utilities
3. **Phase 3**: Migrate API implementation
4. **Phase 4**: Extract UI components
5. **Phase 5**: Migrate web application
6. **Phase 6**: Setup build and deployment

## Benefits

1. **Code Reusability**
   - Share types, utilities, and components
   - Write once, use everywhere

2. **Type Safety**
   - End-to-end type safety
   - Single source of truth for types

3. **Maintainability**
   - Clear boundaries between packages
   - Easier to understand and modify

4. **Scalability**
   - Easy to add new packages (mobile app ready)
   - Microservices-ready architecture

5. **Developer Experience**
   - Better IntelliSense
   - Faster builds with caching
   - Clear import paths

## Next Steps

1. **Review the structure** in `/6fb-platform/`
2. **Read the migration guide** for detailed steps
3. **Start with core package** migration
4. **Set up CI/CD** for the new structure
5. **Train team** on monorepo workflow

## Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start all services
npm run build           # Build all packages
npm test                # Run all tests
npm run validate        # Validate architecture

# Package-specific
nx serve @6fb/web       # Start web app
nx serve @6fb/api       # Start API
nx test @6fb/core       # Test core package
nx storybook @6fb/ui    # Start Storybook

# Utilities
npm run graph           # View dependency graph
npm run affected:test   # Test affected code
npm run format          # Format all code
```

This monorepo structure provides a solid foundation for scaling the 6FB platform while maintaining code quality and architectural integrity.
