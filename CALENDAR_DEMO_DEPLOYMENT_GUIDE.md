# Calendar Demo Pages Deployment Guide

## Summary of Issues and Fixes

### The Problem
The calendar demo pages were returning 404 errors on Railway deployment:
- `/enhanced-calendar-demo` - 404 Not Found
- `/simple-calendar-demo` - 404 Not Found
- `/test-calendar` - 404 Not Found

### Root Causes Identified
1. **Missing Component Imports**: The enhanced-calendar-demo was importing `SmartScheduler` which wasn't exported from the calendar components index
2. **Railway Build Cache**: Railway might be using a cached build that doesn't include the new pages
3. **Deployment Timing**: The pages exist locally but haven't been deployed to Railway yet

### Fixes Applied
1. **Fixed Import Issues**: Commented out the SmartScheduler imports in enhanced-calendar-demo to prevent build errors
2. **Created Verification Scripts**:
   - `scripts/verify-calendar-pages.sh` - Tests if pages are accessible
   - `scripts/fix-railway-deployment.sh` - Helps force Railway to rebuild
3. **Added API Verification Route**: `/api/verify-pages` to check page existence on the server
4. **Created Deployment Marker**: Forces Railway to recognize changes and rebuild

## Calendar Demo Pages Overview

### 1. Simple Calendar Demo (`/simple-calendar-demo`)
- **Purpose**: Basic drag-and-drop demonstration
- **Features**: Simple appointment list with drag functionality
- **Dependencies**: None (standalone React component)
- **Status**: ✅ Ready to deploy

### 2. Enhanced Calendar Demo (`/enhanced-calendar-demo`)
- **Purpose**: Advanced calendar features showcase
- **Features**:
  - Drag-and-drop with snap-to-grid
  - Conflict detection
  - Cascade rescheduling
  - Multiple view modes
- **Dependencies**: DragDropCalendar, PremiumCalendar components
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed and ready to deploy

### 3. Test Calendar (`/test-calendar`)
- **Purpose**: Simple test page to verify deployment
- **Features**: Basic page with links to other demos
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Status**: ✅ Ready to deploy

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub (Trigger Railway Deployment)
```bash
git push origin main
```

### 2. Monitor Railway Deployment
```bash
# If you have Railway CLI installed:
railway logs

# Or check the Railway dashboard
```

### 3. Verify Deployment (After ~5 minutes)
```bash
./scripts/verify-calendar-pages.sh
```

### 4. Test in Browser
Visit these URLs after deployment:
- https://sixfb.bookbarber.com/test-calendar (simplest, test this first)
- https://sixfb.bookbarber.com/simple-calendar-demo
- https://sixfb.bookbarber.com/enhanced-calendar-demo
- https://sixfb.bookbarber.com/api/verify-pages (JSON response)

## If Pages Still Show 404

### Option 1: Force Railway Rebuild
```bash
# Using Railway CLI
railway up --no-cache
```

### Option 2: Add Environment Variable to Force Rebuild
```bash
railway variables set FORCE_REBUILD=$(date +%s)
railway up
```

### Option 3: Check Build Output
Look for these pages in the Railway build logs:
```
├ ○ /enhanced-calendar-demo
├ ○ /simple-calendar-demo
├ ○ /test-calendar
```

### Option 4: Verify Files in Production
```bash
# Check if pages are in the standalone build
railway run ls -la .next/standalone/app
```

## Expected Results

Once deployed successfully:
1. All calendar demo pages should return HTTP 200
2. Pages should load without authentication
3. Basic drag-and-drop functionality should work
4. No backend API calls are required for the demos

## Files Changed

1. **Modified**:
   - `frontend/src/app/enhanced-calendar-demo/page.tsx` - Fixed imports

2. **Created**:
   - `frontend/src/app/deployment-marker.txt` - Forces rebuild
   - `frontend/src/app/api/verify-pages/route.ts` - Verification endpoint
   - `scripts/verify-calendar-pages.sh` - Test script
   - `scripts/fix-railway-deployment.sh` - Deployment helper

## Next Steps

1. **Push the changes**: `git push origin main`
2. **Wait for deployment**: Usually takes 3-5 minutes
3. **Run verification**: `./scripts/verify-calendar-pages.sh`
4. **Test in browser**: Visit the URLs listed above

## Troubleshooting

If you continue to see 404 errors:
1. Check Railway dashboard for build errors
2. Ensure the frontend service is running
3. Check if Next.js is set to standalone mode in production
4. Verify the pages appear in the Next.js build output

For additional help, check:
- Railway logs: `railway logs --tail 100`
- Build output in Railway dashboard
- Network tab in browser DevTools for actual response
