# 6FB Booking Financial Dashboard - Demo Testing Guide

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Testing

### Option 1: Direct API Testing (Immediate)

The backend is currently running at `http://localhost:8000`. You can test the financial dashboard APIs directly:

#### Test Financial Dashboard Endpoints

1. **Shop Metrics API** (Demo Mode):
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/financial/shop-metrics?period=month" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer demo_token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

2. **Barber Revenue API** (Demo Mode):
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/financial/barber-revenue?period=month" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer demo_token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

3. **Payout Summary API** (Demo Mode):
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/financial/payout-summary?period=month" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer demo_token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

4. **API Documentation**:
```bash
open http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### Option 2: Full Frontend Testing

#### Start Both Servers:

1. **Backend Server** (if not running):
```bash
cd backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

2. **Frontend Server**:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

#### Access the Application:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health

### Option 3: Demo Mode Testing (Recommended)

The system includes a comprehensive demo mode that works without real user authentication:

#### Create Demo User:
```bash
cd backend
python -c "
from models.user import User
from config.database import SessionLocal
from passlib.context import CryptContext

db = SessionLocal()
pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=['bcrypt'], deprecated='auto')

demo_user = User(
    email='demo@6fb.com',
    first_name='Demo',
    last_name='User',
    hashed_password=pwd_context.hash('demo123'),
    role='shop_owner',
    is_active=True
)
db.add(demo_user)
db.commit()
print('Demo user created: demo@6fb.com / demo123')
"
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If APIs Return 401 Unauthorized:
The demo mode should work without authentication, but if you get 401 errors:

1. **Login with Demo User**:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "demo@6fb.com", "password": "demo123"}'
```

2. **Use the returned access_token** in subsequent requests:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/financial/shop-metrics?period=month" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

### If Frontend Won't Start:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev
```

### If Backend Won't Start:
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
```
