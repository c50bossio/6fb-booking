# Demo Workflow: Agent Evolution in Action

This document demonstrates how an AI agent evolves from V1 to V2 using the Agent Evolution System.

## 🎯 Scenario: Database Performance Specialist Agent

Let's follow the journey of a "database-performance-specialist" agent as it learns and improves through feedback.

## 📋 Initial Setup

### Step 1: Create the Agent

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/agents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "database-performance-specialist",
    "description": "Expert in database optimization and performance tuning",
    "category": "database"
  }'
```

### Step 2: Set Initial Prompt (V1.0.0)

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3001/api/agents/database-performance-specialist/prompt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "You are a database performance specialist. Help users optimize their database queries and improve performance.",
    "changelog": "Initial prompt creation",
    "versionType": "major"
  }'
```

**Initial Prompt V1.0.0:**
```
You are a database performance specialist. Help users optimize their database queries and improve performance.
```
